      "content": "Some people spend their lives quietly changing others’. Rachel is one of them.<br>\n<br>\nFrom teaching maths to supporting victims of trauma in the police, she has always been the person who shows up when someone needs her most. But it was a moment on duty—standing beside an 18-month-old boy fighting for his life—that changed her direction forever.<br>\n<br>\nIt made her ask: Who will care for him next?<br>\nThat question eventually led her to fostering.<br>\n<br>\nToday, Rachel is a single foster carer with Compass. The skills she gained in teaching and crisis support have become her superpowers: calming dysregulated children, trusting her instincts, understanding the pressures of school, adapting in the moment, and creating a safe, therapeutic home.<br>\n<br>\nShe says the support has been “brilliant,” and that fostering has brought some of the most meaningful moments of her life — including the time her youngest son drew a picture of “his family” and added a respite child who had only arrived that week.<br>\n<br>\n💬 “If you’re a teacher, police officer or emergency worker… you’re already equipped. Absolutely do it – it’s the best thing in the world.”<br>\n<br>\nIf Rachel’s journey speaks to you, fostering might be the next chapter in your life too.<br>\n<br>\n<img src=\"https://scontent-ams2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.30808-6/627059436_1310975377734090_7301282618741902327_n.jpg?stp=dst-jpg_s720x720_tt6&amp;_nc_cat=106&amp;ccb=1-7&amp;_nc_sid=127cfc&amp;_nc_ohc=pO8FSuAkHokQ7kNvwGjVaJU&amp;_nc_oc=AdldblNDviNvw7Gk7ovJ-P-ixOPNWbzJHSJwJaTTcVk2-n3Ol2o_6El3JJEixLLz5qc&amp;_nc_zt=23&amp;_nc_ht=scontent-ams2-1.xx&amp;edm=AJdBtusEAAAA&amp;_nc_gid=wzSYVclqRfiJwF3_N8Cdvg&amp;_nc_tpa=Q5bMBQFD02HuFGmDM73JRUAP-GV5RbdRjDyewlE5qX_y-Db4Str_ggrcuDgGXh6AUvlvBmOyb9MsrJcQ&amp;oh=00_AfvnOH39He8xNCSzcEdlNTfauj1JC7Ve-elNQyg0QYm2zA&amp;oe=6987DDB3\" /><br/><br/><span style=\"font-size:12px; color: gray;\">(Feed generated with <a href=\"https://fetchrss.com/feedLink?w=6979ed9dea1a4f98550937e2\" target=\"_blank\">FetchRSS</a>)</span>",

Wayne created a nine-piece band called <a href=\"https://innergrooveband.com/home\">INNERGROOVE</a>, who have recently released a new single on Spotify!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We spoke to Wayne about the role of Registered Manager, what made him choose fostering, what he loves about his role and his thoughts on what makes a truly great foster carer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Can you tell us about your journey working within foster care? What experiences have shaped your path, and what motivates you to keep making a difference in this field?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“Growing up, my mum was a foster carer, so I spent my childhood in a home where looked-after children were very much part of the family. That experience inspired me to become a support worker, where I took children out, went to activities, and did focused work with them.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“At the age of 21, I became a foster carer myself alongside working as a support worker. I initially started as a respite carer for my mum before being approved as a full-time foster carer. I did this for three years before focusing more on the support worker role. I later became the regional support manager for the service, and was in this role for 5 years, but then decided I wanted to cast the net and learn more about the wider role, so I was sponsored to complete a social work degree.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“From there, I progressed through roles including supervising social worker, team manager, and registered manager at another organisation with two Outstanding (in all areas) Ofsted inspections under my belt whilst working there. I eventually joined Swiis because I wanted to be part of an organisation where the focus is genuinely on children rather than recruitment or profit. Nearly a year in, I can honestly say that the values, ethics, and morals here are in the right place.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>In what ways have your childhood experiences in a fostering household, along with your own journey as a foster carer, shaped the way you support foster carers today?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“Growing up in a fostering household showed me the variety of children who can come into a home and the different behaviours they can present. It also taught me that what you read on paper is not always what happens in real life. Most of the children my mum looked after brought a sense of fun and energy, but naturally, some of the children presented challenges, which was understandable given their experiences. This insight, in addition to the training I attended, helped me understand the impact of trauma and how that can manifest in their behaviour.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“I often think about new foster carers preparing for their first child coming to live with them. There is excitement, nerves, and lots of questions about what to buy or how to get ready. Things may not go exactly as planned, and that is okay.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“From my own experience as a foster carer, I remember feeling excited about a new child coming to live with me and wanting everything to be perfect. When it didn’t go that way, it was initially deflating, but it taught me the importance of communication. Being kept informed and updated at every step would have made me feel calmer and more prepared.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“That lesson has stayed with me and shapes the way we work at Swiis. It is about keeping foster carers informed, letting them know if things change, and showing respect through open and honest communication.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Your Role at Swiis Foster Care</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Could you share a bit about your role — what it involves and what a typical day tends to look like for you?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“I am the Registered Manager here at Swiis North West, and I have been with the team just under a year. Since joining, there have been a lot of transitions, but together we have built a really strong hub with great energy across the team.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“We recently had an ‘Outstanding’ result in our latest Ofsted inspection in November 2025, which is a true reflection of the team, our wonderful foster carers, and young people. The service was already outstanding when I joined, and since then, we have been able to build on that foundation and are now rated ‘Outstanding’ in all areas.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“Day to day, there are a lot of meetings that I take part in as part of my role. I meet regularly with the Stability and Support team, and I also have weekly catch-ups with the admin team to make sure everyone is on the same page and prepared for the week ahead.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“During the panels, I sit in as the panel advisor, where my role is to provide guidance on Swiis policies and procedures and support the decision-making process.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“Alongside all of this, I produce reports on the service we provide and highlight any issues that arise. That all happens before I even start working directly with the foster carers and the team. As part of my role, I am directly responsible to Ofsted. It is a very dynamic job, and no two days are the same.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What do you enjoy most about working at Swiis?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“The people and the team! We have a really strong ethos here, and everyone looks out for each other, and there is a great energy across the whole team. The recent ‘Outstanding’ report from Ofsted has really reinforced that. That honesty and willingness to learn is where our real strength lies.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“I feel it is rewarding sitting in foster carer reviews and panels, listening to the great work our foster carers do, attending activities and getting to know the young people. I try to be as directly involved as possible.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How do you help your team bring the </strong><a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/fostering/find-out-about-swiis/team-and-values/\"><strong>Swiis values</strong></a><strong> to life in their day‑to‑day work?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“It is about keeping everyone aligned, energised, and engaged, and helping them buy into the vision of what we do, which is ultimately supporting foster carers so they can support children. I am really proud of the team we have. We have fantastic support workers, an amazing Education Advisor, brilliant deputy managers, administrators, and other team members who are centrally based, everyone works together as one.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“It’s a really rewarding environment to be part of, and I couldn’t be happier with the team we have built in the North West.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>During the North West’s recent </strong><a href=\"https://files.ofsted.gov.uk/v1/file/50292707\"><strong>Outstanding Ofsted</strong></a><strong> inspection, you were praised for going above and beyond in building relationships with children, foster carers, and staff. Could you share some examples of how you did this and the difference you felt it made?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“I think it&#8217;s all about building personal relationships, and if you are just sending emails or giving the occasional message, you are not really connecting with people. I make it a point to be in the room with them. I attend activities, support groups, and connect with foster carers and children whenever I can.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“When I first joined, I met with all the North West foster carers, and now, with every new foster carer that joins, I go out with the supervising social worker to see them and to go through their carer agreement and get to know them personally. It is about putting a face to a name and making foster carers feel at ease. I want them to know that I am not just someone who turns up when there is a problem and that I am always at the end of the phone if they need support.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“With the team, we work very much as a collective rather than a hierarchy. If a social worker is busy, I will step in and support with visits or other tasks. I think leading by example is important. I would never ask anyone to do something that I would not be willing to do myself. Showing that mindset helps bring energy and motivation to the team and ultimately supports better outcomes for children and foster carers.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>In your view, what qualities make someone a great foster carer?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“I think a great foster carer is someone who doesn’t take themselves too seriously and doesn’t take things personally, as children can sometimes say things that are not meant in the way they come across. Having a good sense of humour is really important, along with integrity, so if you say you are going to do something, you follow through. Being child-centred and a child-focused advocate, as well as flexible and creative, also plays a huge part in supporting children in the best possible way. In addition to the practical tasks (which are plenty!), keeping on top of training and recording completes the role in my view.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-kadence-image kb-image27652_e95f91-a6 size-full\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Ofsted-Blog-North-West-Team.jpg\" alt=\"North West Team\" class=\"kb-img wp-image-27550\" srcset=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Ofsted-Blog-North-West-Team.jpg 1920w, https://www.swiisfostercare.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Ofsted-Blog-North-West-Team-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.swiisfostercare.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Ofsted-Blog-North-West-Team-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" /><figcaption><em>Swiis North West Team</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" style=\"margin-bottom:var(--wp--preset--spacing--50)\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>Wayne’s reflections on fostering and supporting foster carers highlights our commitment to creating positive outcomes for children and young people in care.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By celebrating the teams and individuals who make Swiis exceptional, we aim to demonstrate our dedication to supporting foster carers and the children they care for every step of the way.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/meet-wayne-brown-north-west-registered-manager/\">Meet Wayne Brown: North West Registered Manager</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com\">Swiis Foster Care</a>.</p>",

It’s widely recognised across the health and social care professions that promoting a sense of belonging is not only required to help a child reach their full potential but is essential for a child’s overall emotional and physiological health. Research studies and findings demonstrate that when children feel connected, accepted, and valued within their family, school, and community &#8211; they are better able to form secure relationships, which supports healthy emotional development and positive self-esteem. A strong sense of belonging also reduces stress and anxiety, lowering cortisol levels and supporting healthy brain development, sleep, and immune functioning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating environments where children and young people feel they truly belong can provide the foundation needed for both emotional stability and overall physiological wellbeing. Foster carers can play a crucial role in promoting and developing this sense of belonging by intentionally creating opportunities for connection, inclusion, and developing a shared identity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By engaging in simple, regular activities, such as those detailed below, they can help make a child feel valued and a ‘part of the family’. Taking time to learn about the child’s background, culture, and interests, and weaving these into daily life, can also help them feel respected and understood.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below are some suggestions for different activities which are designed to promote feelings of belonging.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-tact-neutral-neutral-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-9c6ea631a1146cfd61da321817ef738e\" id=\"h-create-a-welcoming-environment\">Create a welcoming environment</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Create a cosy, comfortable and inviting family space for spending downtime together.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Allow children to decorate and personalise their own spaces.

This impacts their entire well-being, from their ability to regulate and communicate their emotions to the way they behave and build connections with others.</p>\n<p>These children need trauma-informed care to help them recover from their experiences and begin building a brighter future.</p>\n<p>When foster parents have had children of their own who have grown up and fled the nest, it can be more challenging for them to relearn trauma-informed methods because they&#8217;ve become so used to applying more traditional parenting approaches.</p>\n<p>However, if you haven&#8217;t had children of your own yet, or they are still fairly young, it&#8217;s unlikely that you&#8217;ll have any preconceived parenting ideas, making it easier to adapt to the needs of children and young people in your care.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"text-small-medium\">Less of a generational gap</span></h3>\n<p>When you foster in your 20s and 30s, the age difference between you and the children you foster is less significant than the average age of a foster parent, which is 54.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll likely be more familiar with technology, current slang, mental health issues, and other challenges children and young people face today. This can make it easier for young people in your care to relate to you about the problems they might be facing during their teenage years.</p>\n<p>As a result, this could help you build a strong bond with the children you foster, as you&#8217;ll be more prepared to support them in navigating the ups and downs of life.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"text-small-medium\">More energy to fulfil your role</span></h3>\n<p>The roles and responsibilities of foster carers mean you need lots of energy, an eagerness to learn, and a willingness to adapt to the changing needs of children in your care.</p>\n<p>From school drop-offs, meetings, and appointments to family time arrangements, days out, and more, foster parent life, although rewarding, can also be demanding.</p>\n<p>Being a young foster parent often means you&#8217;ll have more energy and patience to manage your ever-changing schedule without burning out, making your home more stable for children and young people.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"text-small-medium\">Breaking down stereotypes and role modelling</span></h3>\n<p>Many people believe that you need to have years of life experience to be a good foster parent. Although it can be helpful if you&#8217;ve raised your own children or worked in a similar profession, it’s not necessary, and these misconceptions can prevent younger people from even considering fostering as an option.</p>\n<p>But if you decide to take this step and open your home to the children and young people who need it most, you’ll break down stereotypes and encourage others to do the same.</p>\n<p>You’ll also show your foster children how to manage young adulthood, inspiring them to follow their dreams and build healthy futures.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"text-small-medium\">You can change more lives</span></h3>\n<p>Although there is no foster care age limit, if you begin your fostering journey later in life, there is a possibility it could be cut short by health concerns, as they are more likely to occur as you get older.</p>\n<p>But when you begin your fostering journey in your 20s or 30s, you have more time to make a difference.</p>\n<p>Whether you foster a child long-term, seeing them through to adulthood and beyond, or provide <a href=\"https://www.thefca.co.uk/about-fostering/types-of-fostering/emergency-fostering/\">emergency fostering</a> or respite care and welcome multiple children into your home, you’ll have years in front of you to transform young lives.</p>\n            </div>\n        \n        \n            </div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div id=\"image-text-block_75d3830c30b979c89e23965844e7d0e6\" class=\"custom-block image-text-block alignfull image-right has-none-background-color theme-arrow spacing-top-full spacing-bottom-half width-full\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"content\">\n            <h3>FAQs about fostering in your 20s and 30s</h3>\n<p>We recognise that <a href=\"https://www.thefca.co.uk/about-fostering/how-to-become-a-foster-parent/\">becoming a foster parent</a> is a life-changing decision, so we’ve selected the most common questions we’re asked here at FCA about fostering from younger people to help you make an informed decision.</p>\n                    </div>\n\n                    <div class=\"media\">\n                <img decoding=\"async\" width=\"625\" height=\"417\" src=\"https://www.thefca.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Young-Foster-Parents-625x417.jpg\" class=\"attachment-half-width-desktop size-half-width-desktop\" alt=\"Young Foster Parents\" srcset=\"https://www.thefca.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Young-Foster-Parents-625x417.jpg 625w, https://www.thefca.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Young-Foster-Parents-365x243.jpg 365w, https://www.thefca.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Young-Foster-Parents-875x584.jpg 875w, https://www.thefca.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Young-Foster-Parents-176x117.jpg 176w, https://www.thefca.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Young-Foster-Parents-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.thefca.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Young-Foster-Parents-397x265.jpg 397w, https://www.thefca.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Young-Foster-Parents-952x635.jpg 952w, https://www.thefca.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Young-Foster-Parents.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px\" />            </div>\n            </div>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"content-block-block_f3f1fa14fddf8c3bba922f7a4b08b978\" class=\"custom-block content-block alignfull has-none-background-color theme-none spacing-top-half spacing-bottom-none width-full\" data-columns=\"1\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n\n                    <div class=\"content\">\n                <h4>Can you earn a living as a foster carer?</h4>\n<p>One of the most pressing questions we’re asked by those considering fostering in their 20s and 30s is, <a href=\"https://www.thefca.co.uk/fostering-allowances/\">How much do you get paid to foster?</a></p>\n<p>Although we know money isn’t the primary motivation to become a foster parent, it&#8217;s understandable that you&#8217;d want to make sure that you&#8217;ll feel financially secure on your fostering journey.</p>\n<p>The good news is that when you foster with FCA, you&#8217;ll receive a generous fostering allowance per child, per year, which is typically tax-free. You&#8217;ll also benefit from additional perks, such as bonus payments, length-of-service rewards, and discounts on our foster parent rewards platform.</p>\n<h4>Can you foster as a single person?</h4>\n<p>Absolutely, many of our foster parents choose to foster as a single person. However, during the <a href=\"https://www.thefca.co.uk/about-fostering/how-to-become-a-foster-parent/application-process/\">application process</a>, we’ll need to make sure that you have support from friends and family to make your journey more manageable.</p>\n<p>You’ll also receive support from our incredible community, including social workers, education co-ordinators, therapists, experienced foster parents and more, so you’ll never feel like you’re doing it alone.</p>\n<p>From support groups and meet-ups to events like the Big Sing Off, you&#8217;ll feel welcomed and ready to see where your journey takes you.</p>\n<h4>Can you foster if you rent your home?</h4>\n<p>Yes, you don’t need to own your own home to foster. However, you will need permission from your landlord, and you must have a spare bedroom for a child to make their own.</p>\n<p>You can also <a href=\"https://www.thefca.co.uk/resources/blogs/latest-blogs/moving-home-while-fostering/\">move house while fostering</a>, but if you plan to do so within a few months of approval, we will ask you to apply to foster once you&#8217;ve settled in.</p>\n<h4>Is there room for progression?</h4>\n<p>At FCA, we’re committed to your personal and professional development. That’s why when you foster with us, you’ll receive <a href=\"https://www.thefca.co.uk/about-us/training/\">ongoing training</a> that will not only prepare you for each stage of your fostering journey, but also broaden your knowledge and skills so you can provide more specialist foster care, such as disability fostering.</p>\n<h4>Can you work while fostering?</h4>\n<p>Yes, you can work alongside fostering; however, it depends on the hours you work, the flexibility of your employer, the age of the children you foster, and whether you foster as a couple or on your own.</p>\n<p>Our priority is the well-being of children in your care, and you&#8217;ll need to be available for school drop-offs and holidays, meetings, appointments, training, and all other responsibilities that come with fostering a child.</p>\n            </div>\n        \n        \n            </div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div id=\"image-text-block_2c7174dfb53b3cce9014cdee6aa11042\" class=\"custom-block image-text-block alignfull image-left has-none-background-color theme-none spacing-top-half spacing-bottom-full width-full\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"content\">\n            <h2>Ready to start a meaningful career?</h2>\n<p>If you’re ready to start a meaningful career in fostering and would like to learn more, get in touch today.</p>\n<p>Call us on 0800 023 4561 or submit an enquiry form.

This space is about sharing their stories &#8211; hearing directly from them, understanding their journeys, and seeing why they stand out. So, settle in and get ready to be inspired.</p>\n<p>Victoria Smith &#8211; Bridge to Foster Lead and Senior Practitioner at the Creative Care Solutions team &#8211; introduces Jack Smith (no relation!), a care leaver, public speaker, campaigner, and passionate trans advocate.</p>\n<h2>Victoria</h2>\n<p><strong>Hi Victoria, please tell us about your job. </strong></p>\n<p>I work within the Creative Care Solutions team, liaising between Local Authorities that have a young person ready to move from residential care into foster care and NFG fostering agencies, helping them identify suitable carers. We call this Bridge to Foster. It’s a collaborative process, matching the skills of our foster carers with the needs of the young person. A good match ensures the best chance of success so it’s important to spend time getting it right.</p>\n<p><strong>How long have you been with National Fostering Group? </strong></p>\n<p>I’ve been with NFG for more than nine years, but I recently moved to my role within the Creative Care Solutions team. It’s very different from my previous role as an advanced practitioner and I’m still adapting but I love it and am passionate about Bridge to Foster. Over the next few months, I’ll be visiting agencies across the Midlands to talk about the programme.</p>\n<p><strong>What do you enjoy most about your role? </strong></p>\n<p>I love working with all the different Local Authorities, building relationships with them and learning about their varied processes for assessing young people who are ready to transition into foster care. At the same time, I get to know all our fostering agencies and the skills and experience of their foster carers. I approach each young person with curiosity and an open mind. There can be many different reasons why young people are in residential care. Contrary to what many people think, not all of them are teenagers; some of them are quite young children.</p>\n<p><strong>Why did you nominate Jack as your ‘inspiration’? </strong></p>\n<p>Jack and I spoke at a conference together and I was blown away by what he shared. He talked about his experience of growing up in care – initially with foster carers and, later, in residential care. Although Jack wasn’t fostered by National Fostering Group, I wanted our foster carers to be able to read his story, which is why I chose him for this newsletter. As a trans teenager, Jack faced many challenges and he speaks very eloquently about this. At 18, he moved into semi-supported living and has gone on to do many amazing things. Jack recognises that it might have been helpful for him to transition back into foster care as an older teenager but he also acknowledges that there’s a right and a wrong time to make such a move. I found his insights really interesting and helpful and I hope you do, too.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><strong>Jack</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Welcome, Jack. Please tell us about your experience of growing up in care and your life since leaving care.</strong></p>\n<p>I’m 30 now but I was in care from the age of four. My sister and I went to live with my uncle (my mum’s brother) and his partner, who we didn’t really know. Initially it was just meant to be for a few weeks, but they trained as foster carers and so it became our permanent home.</p>\n<p>For the first five or six years, we were very happy. Our aunt taught us about personal hygiene, we were well-fed, we went on holiday together, we baked cakes together, we became part of their family. But, over the years, my aunt developed a problem with alcohol and, sadly, it stopped being a good experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Wearing boy’s clothes</strong></p>\n<p>When I was about six, I started wanting to be a boy and wear boy’s clothes. I managed to persuade my aunt to let me do this &#8211; my best friend was a bit of a tomboy and that helped. When I went to middle school, I made friends with a group of lads and we used to climb trees and play in the woods together. I loved it and dressing in boy’s clothes made me feel more like a boy.</p>\n<p>Once puberty hit, though, things began to get more difficult. I hated the changes in my body, having boobs felt like the worse thing in the world. Going to secondary school was a scary experience as I wasn’t with my friends anymore. At the end of year seven, I was looking forward to the summer holidays and being able to see my old friends again but then my aunt suddenly decided I wasn’t allowed to play with boys anymore and I had to stop wearing boy’s clothes. By this time, she was drinking more and I think it really affected the way she saw me. That was the worst summer ever. I stayed in bed until 2pm most days.</p>\n<p><strong>No one to talk to</strong></p>\n<p>When I went back to school, I tried to make friends with girls but it was difficult and I became very isolated. My behaviour in the classroom began to suffer and I was often in trouble. I developed a crush on a girl and I felt really ashamed of that. LGBT+ issues were frowned upon at home and there was no one I could talk to about how I was feeling.</p>\n<p>By the time I reached 14, my mental health was really suffering. I ran away to London but got scared because it was such a big, lonely place. I got put on a train and escorted back to the town I came from. I was met at the station by a duty social worker. I said I didn’t want to go back to my aunt and uncle’s home. I was lucky to get a same-day appointment with CAMHS (Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service) and I was sent to stay with my aunt’s mum and dad.</p>\n<p>Although I wasn’t at my aunt and uncle’s house, I was still stressing about being sent back there and, one day, the pastoral care team at school was so concerned that someone took me to A&amp;E. I was assessed and admitted to hospital suffering from psychosis. After two months, I was moved to a secure unit. I stayed there for the next 16 months.</p>\n<p><strong>Taken into residential care</strong></p>\n<p>I was 16 by the time I left and I was taken into residential care. I was still struggling with my mental health but, while I was there, I finally realised I was trans. I told the staff and they were great, they started helping me with my transition. It was a supportive environment and at last I understood what was going on for me.</p>\n<p>When I left care, I went into semi-supported living and finally on to uni. I smashed the first year but I became quite unwell in 2017 and again two years later. After this I was diagnosed with bipolar and that also helped me make more sense of things. I changed my life, got a dog and moved back to the Midlands where I’d been happy in the residential care home.</p>\n<p><strong>A campaigner for LGBT+ young people in care</strong></p>\n<p>Since then, I’ve campaigned for greater support for LGBT+ young people in care. I did my first research study with the University of East Anglia after graduating. I’ve worked with Local Authorities as a volunteer at many different events and spoken with local councillors about how it is for young people leaving care. I’ve made media appearances, including shadowing the then Minister for Children and Families, which was filmed by the BBC. I’ve attended a number of all-party parliamentary group meetings in Westminster and worked with the CQC as an expert by experience investigator. I am passionate about talking to people and have spoken at many different conferences, including alongside Victoria for the NFG.</p>\n<p>For me, being in a residential care home was what I needed at that point in my life. I had just come out of hospital and wasn’t ready to go into a foster home. The staff were fantastic with me and helped me come to terms with being trans; they fought for me to be called Jack in the house despite the Local Authority refusing to call me by this name. They went above and beyond.</p>\n<p><strong>The time has to be right</strong></p>\n<p>I don’t believe in trying to force a young person into a family environment if they’re not ready. I was still hurting from the experience of being fostered by my aunt and uncle and I wouldn’t have been ready at that time. I didn’t want to let anyone in. If I smashed a window, it was just a window, it wasn’t a window in someone’s home. I didn’t feel the staff would reject me for doing it – they see kids like me all the time – but for a foster carer, it would be different.</p>\n<p>Saying that, though, there was a time when I could have transitioned back into a family environment and that would probably have helped me. It’s hard to leave care at 18 and, if I’d been with a foster family I might have had some ongoing support. If I’d been in the right foster home, they could also have advocated for me during my transition which would have helped.</p>\n<p><strong>Go at the young person’s pace</strong></p>\n<p>Thinking about Bridge to Foster, I’d say it’s important to go at the young person’s pace – don’t rush it. Personal touches make a big difference, like being able to choose your own bedding or someone asking what your favourite foods are. If there’s a way to keep the young person in the same school, do it because it can help to keep the same group of friends. Keep as many things as steady and familiar as you can.</p>\n<p>Based on my experience, it’s important not to write off older teenagers going into foster care as it can be a really key time for them’. At the other end of the scale, I see six and seven-year-olds in residential care, which is wrong for them too as they can pick up bad habits. I suppose what I’m saying is it has to be right for the young person at that point in their life, which means listening to them and finding out what they want.</p>\n<p><strong>Keep the door open</strong></p>\n<p>To foster carers who take in a young person and it doesn’t work out, I’d say this: Don’t be disheartened. Just because someone doesn’t stay with you forever, you still made a difference by providing a sense of stability, routine and love for them. Sometimes, residential care is the right thing for a young person and sometimes a foster home is the right thing. I built some amazing bonds in residential care and they really helped me. But, when it <em>is </em>the right time for a young person to experience living in a family, make sure you keep the door open for them.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Jack has written a book about his experiences of growing up in care, which is called 101 Reasons Why I Can’t be the Prime Minister.

But being ready is not something you either have or do not have. <br>\n<br>\nBeth had many questions before she began fostering, including concerns about her birth children and how her home might feel for a foster child. What helped was approaching those worries with curiosity and support rather than self judgement. <br>\n<br>\nThe strongest foster carers are not those who manage everything alone, but those who use the support around them, whether that is family, friends, supervising social workers, training or peer networks. <br>\n<br>\nSupport is not something you turn to if things go wrong.

It is a clear indication that children and young people experience the highest quality care and support possible, enabling them to achieve their goals and ambitions that they may not have been able to. It reflects consistently excellent practice, robust safeguarding, and exceptional leadership across every part of our agency.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">For the Children and Young People in Our Care</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For children, this means they feel safe, valued, and genuinely heard by our foster carers and staff. They are supported to grow in confidence, achieve their goals, and experience the stability and encouragement they need to thrive. It shows that their voices matter and that their wellbeing is at the heart of everything we do.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">For Our Foster Carers</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For foster carers, this recognition reflects the high-quality training, guidance and round-the-clock support they receive, as well as the positive, lasting difference they make to the lives of the children in their care. Swiis foster carers are among the best in the sector, consistently providing nurturing, stable homes where children and young people feel safe, valued and able to thrive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Swiis foster carers know they are never alone. They are part of a supportive community, backed by a dedicated team who are always there, listening, guiding and standing alongside them, fully committed to their success and to the wellbeing and future of every child and young person in their care.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">As a Fostering Agency</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Ofsted only awards ‘Outstanding’ when a fostering agency consistently goes above and beyond for their foster carers and the children within their care. Having consistently ‘Outstanding’ ratings in all areas across our Midlands and South, North East, Yorkshire and North West offices is an exceptionally proud achievement for all Swiis staff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This accomplishment reflects the dedication, compassion and professionalism of every member of the Swiis team. It is a testament to the hard work our staff put in every day and to our unwavering commitment to achieving the best possible outcomes for children and young people.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Highlights From Our Ofsted Reports</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Across the Midlands and South, North East, Yorkshire and North West, children receive nurturing, individualised care that helps them make exceptional progress.

From the very beginning of their fostering journey, carers can access practical advice and proven strategies to support them through any challenging moments.&nbsp; The Stability and Support Team can be accessed directly by the foster carer if preferred and is in addition to the exceptional daily support of the social work teams.&nbsp; This wrap around support ensures foster carers are well equipped to create safe, nurturing environments where children can thrive, grow and overcome barriers they may face.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“Foster carers feel exceptionally well supported and valued by agency staff, which impacts positively on the outcomes of children who are thriving in their foster families.”</em> &#8211; North West Ofsted Report</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Exceptional Safeguarding</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Safeguarding is at the heart of everything we do at Swiis. Children and young people feel safe, supported and valued in our foster homes, cared for by experienced foster carers and supported by highly skilled and committed social work teams. We operate robust and comprehensive safeguarding processes to ensure the highest standards of safety and wellbeing for every child in our care.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Safeguarding is also central to our recruitment, assessment and approval processes. All foster carers and Swiis staff go through rigorous checks and preparation, ensuring they are well trained, confident and fully supported in their role. This strong safeguarding framework promotes stability and enables foster carers to provide safe, nurturing homes where children can thrive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“Safeguarding children is at the centre of the agency.”</em> &#8211; Midlands and South Ofsted Report</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Swiis, every decision and action prioritises the safety and well-being of children. This gives foster carers confidence that they are fully supported when protecting children, knowing they are not alone in ensuring the highest standards of care. Children, in turn, feel secure, protected, and able to build trust with the foster carers caring for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Comprehensive and Relevant Training</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Swiis provides foster carers with comprehensive and practical <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/fostering/training/\">training</a>, giving them the knowledge and confidence they need to meet children’s diverse needs. Well-trained foster carers can respond effectively to both every day and complex situations, helping children feel secure, supported, and understood at all times.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“Highly effective post-approval training ensures that foster carers have the relevant skills and knowledge to undertake the fostering role.”</em> &#8211; North West Ofsted Report</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Child-Focused Leadership and Staff</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Swiis is led by experienced leaders who provide strong oversight and inspire continuous improvement. Staff morale is high, workloads are manageable, and teams work closely together to deliver consistent, high-quality care. All regions have strong partnerships with other professionals to ensure children remain at the centre of all practice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“Foster carers have provided overwhelmingly positive feedback about the support they receive from the agency.”</em> &#8211; Midlands and South Ofsted Report</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Foster carers consistently report feeling valued, supported, and heard. This strengthens fostering home-finding arrangements, enabling children to thrive in stable, nurturing homes where their emotional and developmental needs are met.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“Staff morale is high, and staff say that they love their job.”</em> &#8211; North East Ofsted Report</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Motivated and passionate staff ensure children receive consistent, high-quality care. When staff feel proud and inspired by their work, it directly benefits foster carers and children, creating a supportive environment where everyone can flourish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“Social workers have manageable caseloads and are in weekly contact with their foster carers.”</em> &#8211; North West Ofsted Report</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regular, meaningful contact allows social workers to provide timely guidance, reassurance, and practical support. This ensures foster carers are equipped to meet children’s needs effectively, helping children feel safe, cared for, and supported at every stage of their fostering journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-kadence-image kb-image27548_bc74df-1d size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Ofsted-Blog-North-West-Team.jpg\" alt=\"North West Team\" class=\"kb-img wp-image-27550\" srcset=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Ofsted-Blog-North-West-Team.jpg 1920w, https://www.swiisfostercare.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Ofsted-Blog-North-West-Team-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.swiisfostercare.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Ofsted-Blog-North-West-Team-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>A Huge Thank You!</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We would like to extend our heartfelt thanks to our foster carers, the children, and young people in our care, and every member of the Swiis team.

Above all else, it has been a year where children have thrived, foster carers have felt truly supported, and our teams have gone above and beyond to deliver life-changing care.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A Landmark Year: Ofsted Outstanding – Three Times Over</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The pinnacle of 2025 came in the latter part of the year, when Swiis Foster Care achieved an exceptional milestone: three Ofsted inspections, each awarded Outstanding across all areas. This achievement means that all Swiis regions, including Yorkshire, the North East, the North West, the Midlands and South, are officially rated Outstanding, the highest possible recognition across all areas of our service.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These inspections were embraced by every team member as an opportunity to showcase the exceptional work we do together. An Ofsted Outstanding rating is more than an accolade, it is recognition that children are not only safe but flourishing, supported by stable arrangements, highly skilled foster carers, and leadership that is relentless in its pursuit of excellence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An outstanding award also reflects the fact that our foster carers are exceptionally well trained and supported, with robust safeguarding, strong professional relationships, and a culture of continuous improvement that truly puts children first.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"kb-row-layout-wrap kb-row-layout-id27522_736d13-8b aligncenter wp-block-kadence-rowlayout\"><div class=\"kt-row-column-wrap kt-has-2-columns kt-row-layout-right-golden kt-tab-layout-right-golden kt-mobile-layout-row kt-row-valign-middle\">\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-kadence-column kadence-column27522_f7cf38-f4 kb-section-dir-vertical inner-column-2\"><div class=\"kt-inside-inner-col\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-kadence-image kb-image27522_0cb01e-bc\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"638\" height=\"639\" src=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Ofsted_Outstanding.png\" alt=\"Ofsted - Outstanding provider\" class=\"kb-img wp-image-23878\" srcset=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Ofsted_Outstanding.png 638w, https://www.swiisfostercare.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Ofsted_Outstanding-150x150.png 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 638px) 100vw, 638px\" /></figure></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-kadence-column kadence-column27522_190dd3-00 kb-section-dir-vertical inner-column-1\"><div class=\"kt-inside-inner-col\">\n<p class=\"has--font-size\"><em>&#8220;The independent fostering agency provides highly effective services that consistently exceed the standards of good.

Across Swiis Foster Care, children have experienced increased stability, improved emotional well-being, and the confidence that comes from feeling safe, valued, and listened to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of our children have made significant personal progress, overcoming early trauma with the help of consistent, nurturing foster arrangements. These achievements, whether it’s improved school attendance, renewed self-belief, learning new skills or simply learning to trust again, are powerful reminders of the impact that exceptional foster care can have on a child’s life.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Foster Carers: The Beating Heart of Swiis Foster Care</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2025, Swiis Foster Care truly demonstrated that we are the agency of choice. We recruited the highest number of foster carers in our history, far exceeding the average for fostering agencies nationally. This extraordinary achievement reflects the trust carers place in Swiis and the reputation we have built for outstanding support, training, and care.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our foster carers continue to show unwavering dedication, opening their hearts and homes to children who need them most.

Their role is to work directly with foster carers, offering tailored advice, practical strategies, and specialist guidance around behaviours and complex needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2025, this team had its busiest year yet. Demand grew as carers increasingly accessed this invaluable support, a clear testament to how impactful and trusted the service has become. In response, we expanded the team to ensure every foster carer receives timely, expert help when they need it most.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team also introduced specialist forum groups and topical webinar training, with subjects chosen by our foster carers themselves. This collaborative approach has empowered carers, strengthened peer connections, and further enhanced the quality of care provided to children.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-kadence-advancedbtn kb-buttons-wrap kb-btns27522_43a9fb-e5\"><a class=\"kb-button kt-button button kb-btn27522_dcaf50-18 kt-btn-size-standard kt-btn-width-type-auto kb-btn-global-fill  kt-btn-has-text-true kt-btn-has-svg-false  wp-block-kadence-singlebtn\" href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/fostering/support/stability-and-support-team/\"><span class=\"kt-btn-inner-text\">View The Stability &amp; Support Team</span></a></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Looking Ahead to 2026</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As we reflect on 2025, we do so with immense pride.

And as we look to the future, one thing remains certain: Swiis Foster Care will continue to go above and beyond, because every child deserves nothing less.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we move into 2026, our commitment remains unwavering. At Swiis Foster Care, we will continue to evolve and strengthen the support we provide to both our foster carers and the children and young people in their care. Everything we do is guided by one clear purpose: ensuring that every child can feel safe, nurtured, and supported to achieve their full potential.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those choosing to begin their fostering journey with Swiis, we are committed to making that experience as supportive, flexible, and stress-free as possible. From the very first conversation, through assessment, approval, and beyond, our focus is on supporting our carers every step of the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the next few months, we will be sharing more about the wonderful achievements of our children, celebrating their progress, resilience, and successes. We will also be highlighting the vital role of our social work teams and our foster carers, alongside the specialist provision offered by our Stability and Support Team, giving greater insight into how this enhanced support continues to make a meaningful difference for carers and children alike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, we will be sharing more details about the feedback from our Ofsted Outstanding inspection outcomes, helping to demonstrate what outstanding practice looks like and how it directly benefits the children we support.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/swiis-foster-care-highlights-of-an-extraordinary-2025/\">Swiis Foster Care: Highlights of an Extraordinary 2025</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com\">Swiis Foster Care</a>.</p>",

about leaving her job after 32 years, going through the assessment and panel process, the training and support she receives from us here at FCA, and what it felt like to welcome a young person into

She liked the idea of helping children who needed a safe, stable home but she just wasn’t sure when the right moment would be.</p>\n<p>“I’d always thought about fostering and thought it would be a nice thing to do,” she says. “A friend of mine started fostering and said, ‘Would you like me to give you my social worker’s number?’ And it all started from there.”</p>\n                            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"content-block-block_1635c5a6c49a12f2fa426fcf05c7e1a0\" class=\"custom-block content-block alignfull has-none-background-color theme-none spacing-top-half spacing-bottom-half width-full\" data-columns=\"1\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n\n                    <div class=\"content\">\n                <p><span class=\"text-medium\" style=\"color: #e5007e;\"><strong>Moments that make it all worthwhile</strong></span></p>\n<p>Over the years, Debbie has welcomed many children with different backgrounds and needs. One young person stands out.</p>\n<p>“We had a child come to live with us who was quite challenging at the time,” she explains. “He was from another country, and his culture was very different to ours. It was challenging for him and for us.”</p>\n<p>Debbie never expected him to stay in touch — but he did.</p>\n<p>“When he left, I didn’t think he would keep in touch, but he did and he still does to this day. Any problems he has, or difficulties, or even achievements, he’ll always come back and tell us, which is lovely.”</p>\n<p>Another moment that means a lot to Debbie involves a young person she cares for now.</p>\n<p>“When she came to live with us, she found it quite difficult — especially around men, including my husband,” Debbie says. “As time went on, she got more relaxed. The moment she just went up and gave him a hug… that was really, really nice. That was one of my favourite moments.”</p>\n<p><span class=\"text-medium\" style=\"color: #e5007e;\"><strong>The qualities that matter</strong></span></p>\n<p>Debbie believes empathy is the most important part of fostering.</p>\n<p>“You need to have that empathy for children because they come from all different backgrounds,” she says. “For somebody to just turn up at your home and have to live with another family &#8211; it’s really, really hard. I’d find it difficult, let alone a little child.”</p>\n            </div>\n        \n        \n            </div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div id=\"image-text-block_cdc824443fe16ef527f9d99c228e6e7b\" class=\"custom-block image-text-block alignfull image-right has-none-background-color theme-none spacing-top-none spacing-bottom-full width-full\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"content\">\n            <p><span class=\"text-medium\" style=\"color: #e5007e;\"><strong>Support that’s always there</strong></span></p>\n<p>For Debbie, FCA’s support has made a big difference to her fostering journey.</p>\n<p>“We receive lots of support from FCA, and it can be in different ways,” she explains. “If there’s something we’re finding difficult or challenging, we can always go and ask. If there’s something we’re not sure of, there&#8217;s always somebody on the end of the phone. Even if our social worker’s off, there’s always someone we can contact.”</p>\n<p><span class=\"text-medium\" style=\"color: #e5007e;\"><strong>Her advice?</strong></span></p>\n<p>After 15 years, Debbie still loves fostering &#8211; and she encourages others to explore it too.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“If you’re thinking about fostering, it’s worth finding out more. You don’t have to know everything, you just need to care. The rest comes with support.”</p></blockquote>\n                    </div>\n\n                    <div class=\"media\">\n                <img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"625\"

It can also be such a rewarding experience for foster families and their children too.

Change a Child’s World</span></h3>\n<p>There are <a href=\"https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/find-statistics/children-looked-after-in-england-including-adoptions/\"><strong>over 80,000 children in care in England</strong></a>. Many of these children will have been through things that no child should ever have to experience. Whether that’s physical abuse, being left to fend for themselves, or losing a parent. Becoming a foster parent and giving a child in care all the love, nurture and support they need will help make an extraordinary difference to their future.</p>\n<p>Plus, there are so many different ways that you can help look after children. You may wish to start by offering short-term foster care to children, which means you will be in a child’s life for up to two years. This is often while they’re going through court proceedings, which can be an incredibly turbulent and distressing time.</p>\n<p>Or you may want to be a <a href=\"https://www.orangegrovefostercare.co.uk/about-fostering/types-of-fostering/long-term-fostering/\">long-term foster parent</a>, where you welcome a child into your home for many years until they turn 18. This is a completely different experience of fostering, where a child can truly become part of your family. Often, the bonds developed over these years continue into adulthood too.</p>\n<p>All types of fostering can be incredibly rewarding, and whichever path you choose, you really can change a child’s world.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"text-small-medium\" style=\"color: #e87722;\">2. Fostering Can Be Great Fun</span></h3>\n<p>While there will be challenging days when you foster – like raising any child – there will also be so many great times that you’ll share together.</p>\n<p>As a foster parent, you’ll help children in your care experience the childhood they deserve – and this can be a lot of fun. Whether it’s taking them on their first holiday, watching them take to the stage at the school panto, or singing and dancing to their favourite songs in the kitchen while you’re preparing dinner. Children bring so much joy and laughter to our lives, and you can do the same for them.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"text-small-medium\" style=\"color: #e87722;\">3. Provide Stability When They Need It the Most</span></h3>\n<p>If you stop to think about it, children in foster care are there with you because they can’t be with their parents right now – perhaps ever. They’ve already seen some of the worst that life has to throw at them and often feel all alone in a world that is crumbling down around them.</p>\n<p>You can help them to feel less isolated as they navigate the world around them, and it may not be as difficult as you think. Sometimes all it takes is just being there, just showing them that you are not going anywhere. That sense of stability is what they need most and can really make a difference to children in foster care.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"text-small-medium\" style=\"color: #e87722;\">4. The Application Process is a Journey, Not a Commitment</span></h3>\n<p>Remember, just by taking that first step to learn more about fostering doesn’t mean you’re committed. The <a href=\"https://www.orangegrovefostercare.co.uk/about-fostering/how-to-become-a-foster-parent/application/\">fostering application process</a> is a journey that will help you discover whether fostering is right for you and, if you’re right for fostering.</p>\n<p>Plus, at Orange Grove, we will always move at a pace that’s right for you. You will never feel pressured to move to the next stage if you don’t feel ready.</p>\n<p>We are committed to providing the training and support that you need throughout the entire fostering process, from in person training to e-learning. You will also have an experienced team around you to give you and your family all the support that you need at each step of your journey.</p>\n\n                            </div>\n        \n            </div>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"cta-banner-block-block_616386fa81f320d79613eefa13d0999a\" class=\"custom-block cta-banner-block alignfull has-dark-orange-background-color has-dark-background theme-none spacing-top-half spacing-bottom-half width-full text-align-right\">\n    \n    <div class=\"container cta-banner-columns\">\n        \n        <div class=\"content\">\n            <p><span class=\"sub-heading text-medium\">Start your fostering journey here</span></p>\n<p><span class=\"text-small-medium\">Download our brochure and discover everything you need to know about fostering with Orange Grove.</span></p>\n        </div>\n\n                    <div class=\"wp-block-buttons is-layout-flex wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex\">\n                                    <div class=\"wp-block-button \">\n                        <a class=\"wp-block-button__link wp-element-button\"  href=\"/guide-to-fostering/\">\n                            DOWNLOAD GUIDE                        </a>\n                    </div>\n                            </div>\n            </div>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"content-block-block_b7db11757f11f480fba7929c13309e9f\" class=\"custom-block content-block alignfull has-none-background-color theme-none spacing-top-full spacing-bottom-half width-full\" data-columns=\"1\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n\n                    <div class=\"content\">\n                <h2><span style=\"color: #32781b;\">Are You Ready to Take Your First Step in <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">2026?</span></span></h2>\n<p>“We wish we started fostering sooner,” is something we hear our foster parents say all the time.

Hosted by Faye, the podcast brings together real voices from across the <a href=\"https://www.polariscommunity.co.uk/\">Polaris Community</a>, including care-experienced people, foster parents, those who grew up in fostering households, and fostering professionals. Together, they talk openly and honestly about what fostering is really like – the ups, the challenges, and everything in between.</p>\n<p>In the first three episodes, you’ll hear from Jo August, our CEO, who grew up in a fostering family and brings over 35 years’ experience in the sector; Alison and Theresa, foster parents, sharing their personal journeys; and Jim McGarrigle, Responsible Individual across a number of our fostering services.</p>\n<p>All offering insight from years of professional experience. Together, they explore fostering from every angle, grounded in real life, not theory.</p>\n<p>The podcast is full of honest stories from foster parents, myth-busting conversations about fostering, practical tips, and insights from the journey. You’ll also hear from care-experienced staff, people who grew up in fostering, and long-time foster carers. It’s perfect for anyone who is curious about fostering, unsure if it’s right for them, or looking for reassurance from people who’ve been there.</p>\n<p>It’s a space to listen, learn, and reflect, hearing real experiences that can help you decide what fostering might look like for you.</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"emoji\" role=\"img\" draggable=\"false\"

So, I looked into fostering, got some information, found out about it… had lots of appointments, found out loads of details, and then decided to give it a go.”</p>\n                            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"content-block-block_495f5d7b0336fa434f1f5b1595062a73\" class=\"custom-block content-block alignfull has-none-background-color theme-none spacing-top-half spacing-bottom-none width-full\" data-columns=\"1\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n\n                    <div class=\"content\">\n                <p><span class=\"text-medium text-small-medium\" style=\"color: #1d57a5;\"><strong>Tracy’s introduction to fostering </strong></span></p>\n<p>Tracy’s first three years as a foster parent were with her local authority in Shropshire. But after relocating to the North West, she felt ready for a fresh start.</p>\n<p>“On our relocation, I got in touch with a foster carer who recommended FCA,” she explains. “So I got in touch with the agency. Somebody came round, we had a chat, and we went through the process again and joined <a href=\"https://www.thefca.co.uk/regions/north-west/\">FCA North West</a>.”</p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"text-medium text-small-medium\" style=\"color: #1d57a5;\">Keeping siblings together</span></strong></p>\n<p>Their first foster child was part of a sibling group, but only one child could be placed with them at the time. It made a lasting impact.</p>\n<p>“We saw the grief of a child who’d been separated from her siblings,” Tracy says. “So when she left our care, we decided we wanted a bigger family home so we could <a href=\"https://www.thefca.co.uk/about-fostering/types-of-fostering/fostering-siblings/\">foster sibling groups</a>. We wanted to keep them together.”</p>\n<p>That decision shaped everything that came next. Now Tracy and her husband care for three sisters, aged seven, eight and nine. “I’ve had them for the last three years,” she says proudly. “They’re long-term matched with me.”</p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"text-medium text-small-medium\" style=\"color: #1d57a5;\">Watching children thrive</span></strong></p>\n<p>For Tracy, the real highlights of fostering are the moments of growth.</p>\n<p>“The highlights of fostering, I’d say, are seeing the child thrive, grow and smile in your care,” she says. “To know that they can be happy and get on with their lives and still have contact with their birth family.”</p>\n<p>One teenager stands out in her mind.</p>\n<p>“She came into care having lots of difficulties at school. Through care, nurture and help, we got her back into a mainstream school. We got her the help she needed — the diagnoses she needed. She was actually dyslexic, but she’d been classed as a naughty child, a distracted child. With support, she sat her exams. That was a massive change.”</p>\n            </div>\n        \n        \n            </div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div id=\"image-text-block_cd3b6a5d4cfd61c6e5ee8d814052f518\" class=\"custom-block image-text-block alignfull image-right has-none-background-color theme-none spacing-top-half spacing-bottom-full width-full\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"content\">\n            <p><span class=\"text-medium text-small-medium\" style=\"color: #1d57a5;\"><strong>“The support with FCA is absolutely amazing.”</strong></span></p>\n<p>When Tracy talks about FCA, she doesn’t hesitate. “The support with FCA is absolutely amazing — one of the main reasons we made the decision to go with this agency,” she says.</p>\n<p>And the support comes in all shapes and sizes.</p>\n<p>“It’s foster carer get-togethers, activities they put on for the children — including birth families. We have monthly support groups in the North West. We meet at the Chorley office.

With their children grown and grandchildren regularly visiting, they knew they had <strong>time, space and patience</strong> to offer – they just needed to take the first step.</p>\n<p>After researching agencies, they chose Fosterplus and started the journey of <a href=\"https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/becoming-foster-parent/\">becoming a foster parent</a>.

They’ve raised children, welcomed grandchildren and weathered family ups and downs. That experience gives them perspective when things feel tough. With teenagers in particular, Carl finds that shared understanding helps him stay calm and connect.</p>\n<p>They chose to foster children aged 4–18 so they could match their energy and lifestyle to the needs of the children. For anyone wondering if they’re “too old” to foster, Carl and Jackie are very clear: if you can offer <strong>love, time and stability</strong>, age shouldn’t stop you.</p>\n\n                            </div>\n        \n            </div>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"cta-banner-block-block_cd0ff02503c3baf4b75f7f85ddfeafcf\" class=\"custom-block cta-banner-block alignfull has-dark-blue-background-color has-dark-background theme-none spacing-top-half spacing-bottom-half width-full text-align-right\">\n    \n    <div class=\"container cta-banner-columns\">\n        \n        <div class=\"content\">\n            <p><span class=\"text-small-medium\"><strong>Curious about fostering later in life</strong></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"text-small-medium\">Discover everything you need to know from our &#8216;who can foster&#8217; page.</span></p>\n        </div>\n\n                    <div class=\"wp-block-buttons is-layout-flex wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex\">\n                                    <div class=\"wp-block-button \">\n                        <a class=\"wp-block-button__link wp-element-button\"  href=\"https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/about-fostering/who-can-foster/\">\n                            Who Can Foster                        </a>\n                    </div>\n                            </div>\n            </div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div id=\"image-text-block_5d504e8d10b616764d4392d4069b32f6\" class=\"custom-block image-text-block alignfull image-right mobile-image-first has-none-background-color theme-multiple-misshapen-circles spacing-top-half spacing-bottom-half width-full\" data-emergence=\"hidden\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"content\">\n            <h3><span class=\"text-medium\"><strong>Choosing to keep siblings together</strong></span></h3>\n<p>After their first long-term placement with an 11-year-old boy, Carl and Jackie were asked to consider something new: fostering a brother and sister who had previously lived with another foster family.</p>\n<p>Initially, there were questions about whether the siblings should stay together. Carl’s instinct was immediate and firm – if they were going to foster, they wanted both children.</p>\n<p>He knew that for many children in care, their brothers or sisters are <strong>the one constant link to their past, their family and their identity</strong>. Research shows that placing siblings together can lead to more stable, positive outcomes, wherever it’s safe and appropriate to do so.</p>\n<p>So Carl and Jackie said yes – on the condition that the siblings stayed together.</p>\n<p>The early days were loud, emotional and full of adjustment. There were slammed doors, stomping up the stairs and plenty of bickering. But as Carl and Jackie got to know each child as an individual, they also began to see how much the two meant to each other.</p>\n<p>Their home became a place where sibling relationships were protected and understood, even on the difficult days, showing just how important <a href=\"https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/about-fostering/types-of-fostering/fostering-siblings/\"><strong data-start=\"243\" data-end=\"265\">fostering siblings</strong></a> can be in helping children maintain their identity, connection and sense of belonging.</p>\n                    </div>\n\n                    <div class=\"media\">\n                <div class=\"img-wrapper\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"450\" height=\"516\" src=\"https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Carl-Jackie-e1765978612893.png\" class=\"attachment-half-width-desktop size-half-width-desktop\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Carl-Jackie-e1765978612893.png 450w, https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Carl-Jackie-e1765978612893-365x419.png 365w, https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Carl-Jackie-e1765978612893-176x202.png 176w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" /></div>\n            </div>\n            </div>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"content-block-block_9a9e11f96cf69981c17d121f1e7be960\" class=\"custom-block content-block alignfull has-light-grey-background-color theme-none spacing-top-half spacing-bottom-half width-full\" data-columns=\"1\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n\n                    <div class=\"content\">\n                <h3><span class=\"text-medium\"><strong>Belonging, identity and bonds that go both ways</strong></span></h3>\n<p>For Carl and Jackie, fostering is as much about belonging as it is about everyday routines.</p>\n<p>Over time, they noticed subtle changes. A child who once ran upstairs and slammed doors began staying to talk things through. Another, who first wanted to be introduced as a “foster child”, later chose to simply be seen as one of the grandchildren on a family holiday.</p>\n<p>“<em>That’s about belonging</em>,” Jackie reflects. “<em>They’re starting to understand who they are, and where they fit – and we’re part of that picture now</em>.”</p>\n<p>Their bond with the children has been tested and strengthened through some deeply personal moments too. When Carl and Jackie lost their adult son, they offered their foster son the chance to go into respite, knowing their home would be a sad and unsettled place for a while.</p>\n<p><strong>Instead, he chose to stay. He told them he was part of the family – that he’d been there for the laughs, so he wanted to be there for the tears as well. For Carl and Jackie, that simple decision said everything about the two-way bond they had built.</strong></p>\n\n                            </div>\n        \n            </div>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"content-block-block_4ae494dc68a187f8e128d07b76560860\" class=\"custom-block content-block alignfull has-yellow-background-color theme-misshapen-circle-large spacing-top-half spacing-bottom-half width-full\" data-columns=\"1\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n\n                    <div class=\"content\">\n                <h3><strong>Small steps that change a child’s world</strong></h3>\n<p>Some of Carl and Jackie’s favourite memories are simple, ordinary moments that reveal how far a child has come. Their foster daughter is naturally anxious and easily startled by loud noises. On a holiday in France, she initially refused to go into a freshwater lake, choosing instead to “guard the bikes” on the shore. Carl and Jackie didn’t push – they let her set the pace.</p>\n<p>Slowly, she edged closer to the water. First paddling at the shoreline, then splashing in the shallows, and finally swimming in the lake, laughing with them as if she’d been doing it all her life. For Jackie, watching that transformation from fear to joy in her own time, was one of their proudest fostering moments.</p>\n<p>Another young person, who stayed for just three days, sent a message on her 18th birthday to thank them for their kindness and ask to stay in touch. That short placement left a lasting imprint on all of them, and reinforced the idea that <strong>even brief moments of care can make a lifelong difference</strong>.</p>\n\n                            </div>\n        \n            </div>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"content-block-block_debe61b8c097a4cd28e148f2e6e7ff97\" class=\"custom-block content-block alignfull has-light-grey-background-color theme-image-with-circle-centre-right spacing-top-half spacing-bottom-half width-full\" data-columns=\"1\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n\n                    <div class=\"content\">\n                <h3><span class=\"text-medium\"><strong>Support, training and a wider network around the family</strong></span></h3>\n<p>Carl and Jackie are clear that they don’t do this alone. They see themselves as the “front runners” – the ones there day in, day out – but they know there is a strong team behind them.</p>\n<p>They have:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A supervising social worker who visits regularly and knows the children well</li>\n<li>Children’s social workers who meet with the young people and listen to their views</li>\n<li>Senior staff they can turn to when extra support is needed</li>\n<li>Admin and office staff who are a “font of knowledge” when anything practical crops up</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On top of that, they take part in training – both mandatory courses and flexible online or in-person sessions – and value learning from other foster parents over a cup of tea as much as from formal modules. Fosterplus provides a blended programme of <a href=\"https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/about-us/training/\">training</a> and <a href=\"https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/about-us/support/\">support</a> so families like Carl and Jackie’s never feel they are managing on their own.</p>\n<p>They also offer <strong>short breaks (respite)</strong>, welcoming other foster children into their home for weekends or holidays. It gives other carers a breather, and gives their own foster children the chance to meet children and share experiences.</p>\n\n                            </div>\n        \n            </div>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"content-block-block_3dd2138ccaffd92885909375741640af\" class=\"custom-block content-block alignfull has-none-background-color theme-image-with-circle-top-centre spacing-top-half spacing-bottom-half width-full\" data-columns=\"1\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n\n                    <div class=\"content\">\n                <h3><span class=\"text-medium\"><strong>“We did it together”</strong></span></h3>\n<p>When Carl and Jackie think about the future, they imagine their foster children as adults, returning for visits, sharing news of jobs, homes and families of their own.</p>\n<p>They hope those young people will look back and say, “We did it together.” That they’ll remember a home where siblings stayed side by side, where they were listened to, where there was space for both laughter and tears – and where they always felt they had a place.</p>\n<p>For Carl and Jackie, fostering has been challenging, emotional and eye-opening.

Many people have thought about starting a career where they can make a difference, and one of the most fulfilling paths you can take is to become a foster carer.</strong></p>\n<p>Fostering can often feel like a huge decision with many factors to consider. Weighing up a desire to help vulnerable children against personal commitments and <a href=\"https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/resources/news-blogs/blogs/finances-and-fostering/\">financial pressures</a> may create hesitation for people thinking of applying.</p>\n<p>However, there has never been a better or more important time to consider starting a career in fostering. From a shortage of foster families to job satisfaction, let’s take a look at six reasons why you should become a foster carer in 2026.</p>\n                    </div>\n\n                    <div class=\"media\">\n                <div class=\"img-wrapper\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"540\" height=\"540\" src=\"https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/why-its-the-right-time-to-start-fostering.jpg\" class=\"attachment-half-width-desktop size-half-width-desktop\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/why-its-the-right-time-to-start-fostering.jpg 540w, https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/why-its-the-right-time-to-start-fostering-365x365.jpg 365w, https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/why-its-the-right-time-to-start-fostering-176x176.jpg 176w, https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/why-its-the-right-time-to-start-fostering-298x298.jpg 298w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px\" /></div>\n            </div>\n            </div>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"content-block-block_f30939344ccc319d216efa3c2dd8662f\" class=\"custom-block content-block alignfull has-none-background-color theme-none spacing-top-none spacing-bottom-half width-narrow\" data-columns=\"1\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n\n                    <div class=\"content\">\n                <h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">6 Reasons to start fostering in 2026</h2>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3>Shortage of foster families</h3>\n<p>There is a national shortage of foster carers able to offer a safe and loving home to children in need. In 2023, there were approximately <a href=\"https://learning.nspcc.org.uk/media/mjrls2ci/statistics-briefing-children-care.pdf\">107,000 looked-after children in the UK</a>, an 8% increase over a period of five years.</p>\n<p>If you have a spare room and feel you could foster a child or young person, then you’re needed more than ever to step forward and help make a difference to the lives of vulnerable children.</p>\n<h3>Generous fostering allowances and benefits</h3>\n<p>Financial concerns shouldn’t affect your ability to help children in care. We have all felt the pinch of recent cost-of-living struggles, which have placed finances at the forefront of people’s minds. Although money isn’t the main consideration when thinking about fostering, foster parents do receive generous payments for looking after children.</p>\n<p>In recognition of the valuable work and dedication of our foster carers, we offer a generous fostering allowance and benefits package. Approved foster carers at Fosterplus receive an allowance between £20,187 and £25,749 per child, per year. This amount is generally tax-free and won’t affect any benefits you receive.</p>\n<p>Additional benefits and allowances for things such as birthdays, holidays and celebrations are also included. This way, children in your care can enjoy these special occasions without added financial pressure.</p>\n<p>Our allowances and perks mean more people are able to consider <a href=\"https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/becoming-foster-parent/\">becoming a foster parent</a>, and it is a great time to take on this rewarding role, while also being paid generously for it.</p>\n<h3>New tax cut for foster carers</h3>\n<p>Alongside a generous foster care allowance, the government adjust the tax-free amount of <a href=\"https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/fostering-allowances/tax-allowance/\">qualifying care relief</a> each April that foster carers are able to claim. For the 2025/2026 tax year, this was increased to a fixed amount of £19,690. Weekly amounts are also allowed for carers per child, with £415 per week for children under 11 and £495 per week for children aged 11 or over.</p>\n<p>This additional tax relief for foster carers means that families will now receive the majority – if not all – of their <a href=\"https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/fostering-allowances/\">fostering allowance</a> without paying any tax. If you’ve been concerned about affording to foster, then this exciting update will be a significant benefit to your household finances.</p>\n<h3>Family networks</h3>\n<p>Creating family networks is another positive reason to start fostering in 2026. The connections you will gain, not only with our social work teams but also with other families who foster, make fostering and helping children in care a worthwhile thing to do.</p>\n<p>We have a large <a href=\"https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/about-us/support/\">supportive network</a>, regular events and support groups, as well as social get-togethers to suit everyone, so that you can connect with like-minded families and build lifelong friendships.</p>\n<p>If you have your own birth children, you will see them build relationships, gain confidence, and benefit from a new experience and view of the world. Family and connection are what it’s all about, and it’s certainly something that foster care can offer.</p>\n<h3>Flexibility to suit your family</h3>\n<p>Did you know that around 1 in 3 UK employees are unhappy in their jobs?</p>\n<p>A number of careers are seeing more pressure, such as NHS workers, nursing and teaching staff. Roles like these provide fantastic experience, and many people are now choosing to apply their transferable skills to fostering.</p>\n<p>As a foster parent, you get to work flexibly from home. With the various <a href=\"https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/about-fostering/types-of-fostering/\">types of foster care</a> available, ranging from one day to several years, and our careful matching process, each fostering experience is unique and planned to suit your family.</p>\n<p>Many people continue to <a href=\"https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/about-fostering/who-can-foster/can-i-work-foster/\">work alongside fostering</a>, and with new flexibility in the workplace, it is something that has now become more achievable. In terms of income, there is a great opportunity to feel more financially secure while working and fostering.</p>\n<h3>Job satisfaction</h3>\n<p>Some of the main factors that people consider when looking for a new profession are job fulfilment, flexibility and good colleagues.

That’s why we’re taking cross-government action to transform life chances for these children and care leavers. This package of health measures will make a tangible difference to reduce health inequalities, keep more children safe and help more families with intensive support. It also delivers on recommendations from the independent review of children’s social care that I published in 2022. This government is delivering meaningful change to break down barriers to opportunity, especially for those in care.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Childrens Minister has achieved more in 4 months than the 11 previous Ministers did in the 8 years since the excellent Ed Timpson left the post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2026 promises to be a transformative year in the sector with more Regional Care Co-Ops being launched, the proposed Child Protection Authority being created and the forthcoming children’s wellbeing and schools bill being passed. This will enshrine in law a requirement for the government and public bodies to take into account the challenges faced by children in care and care leavers and the support they may need when leaving the care system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read more here: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/dec/23/young-care-leavers-england-free-prescriptions-dental-eye-services\">https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/dec/23/young-care-leavers-england-free-prescriptions-dental-eye-services</a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/news/government-extends-free-prescriptions-dental-and-eye-care-to-all-care-experienced-people-until-25/\">Government Extends Free Prescriptions, Dental and Eye Care to All Care Experienced People Until 25</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk\">TACT</a>.</p>",

Every year, around 36,000 children come into care; however, there are not enough foster parents available to care for them. This means vulnerable children are more likely to be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Separated from their siblings.</li>\n<li>Experience frequent moves.</li>\n<li>Live in residential care.</li>\n<li>Have their education disrupted.</li>\n<li>Live far away from the communities they&#8217;re familiar with.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Growing up without the stability of a safe and loving home can affect every aspect of a child&#8217;s development, from their ability to form relationships to the way they process and regulate emotions.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s why foster care is one of the most rewarding careers you can choose. Whether you provide a child with a safe home for a few nights or support them through school and prepare them for independent living, the work you&#8217;ll do as a foster parent can make all the difference to their life-long outcomes.</p>\n<p>Here are six more reasons why you should consider a foster care career in 2026.</p>\n                            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"content-block-block_32f3d291a34276433c5a62d0821047f3\" class=\"custom-block content-block alignfull has-dark-teal-background-color has-dark-background theme-none spacing-top-full spacing-bottom-full width-full\" data-columns=\"2\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n\n                    <div class=\"content\">\n                <h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">6 reasons to start fostering in 2026</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n            </div>\n        \n                    <div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n                                    <div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n                        <h3><span class=\"text-small-medium\">It’s a career that truly makes a difference</span></h3>\n<p>Unlike many desk jobs, fostering actively makes a world of difference. It’s crucial in helping to ensure the next generation of children grow up in healthy, secure environments with the chance to reach their full potential.</p>\n<p>Foster carers don’t just provide a safe place for children to live – they are role models, teachers and parents all rolled into one. With the help of foster families, foster children can learn to overcome trust issues, build confidence and grow into successful young adults with promising careers of their own. Many even go on to have careers in the foster care system themselves, creating a positive cycle of change.</p>\n<p>It’s not only life-changing for the foster children, but it’s also a rich, rewarding experience for you and your family. Fostering can open your eyes to new cultures, teach you things about yourself you never knew and give you a deeper purpose in life.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"text-small-medium\">You’ll leave a legacy that matters</span></h3>\n<p>Fostering is a career that enables you to leave a legacy that matters. Whether you offer long-term or <a href=\"https://www.thefca.co.uk/about-fostering/types-of-fostering/short-term-fostering/\">short-term fostering</a>, you&#8217;ll help children by passing on wisdom, supporting them through life&#8217;s ups and downs, and creating family traditions.</p>\n<p>It can be little things, like teaching a child how to brush their teeth, to bigger things like helping a teenager get back onto a positive path. Everything you do as a foster parent goes towards helping children develop independence and become the best versions of themselves. Now that’s something to be proud of.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"text-small-medium\">Thousands of children need a home</span></h3>\n<p>When a child enters the care system, they are scared and confused. Being separated from their birth family, even those who have been abusive or neglectful, can cause a child significant stress.</p>\n<p>In England, there are over 80 thousand children considered looked after, and they need loving, supportive foster parents who can provide them with the stability they need to thrive.</p>\n<p>When you decide to embark upon a foster care career, you’re not just choosing a job to pay the bills. It’s a commitment to giving every child the opportunity to live a happy, healthy life.</p>\n                    </div>\n                                    <div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n                        <h3><span class=\"text-small-medium\">You don’t need any experience</span></h3>\n<p>You don’t need to have superpowers to be a brilliant foster parent. Skills you’ve learned in previous jobs, through having your own children or nuggets of wisdom you’ve picked up in life, can play a big part in your role as a foster carer.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thefca.co.uk/resources/blogs/latest-blogs/care-workers-make-great-foster-carers/\">Transferable skills</a> like empathy, being a good listener, compassion, resilience, an open mind and having a bucket-load of patience are all traits we look for in future foster parents.</p>\n<p>You don’t even need previous experience in caring for a child. Of course, this is an added bonus if you have, but it’s the personal qualities that stand out to us. As long as you’re determined to make a difference, we can help you become a great foster parent.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"text-small-medium\">Professional development and 24/7 support</span></h3>\n<p>With many careers, it’s easy to hit a ceiling; however, being a foster parent means you’re always learning something new. At FCA, we understand that fostering is a career, which is why we actively encourage your professional development.</p>\n<p>When you join us, you&#8217;ll have access to our <a href=\"https://www.thefca.co.uk/about-us/training/\">high-quality training courses</a> where you can enhance your existing skills or specialise in specific areas, such as fostering children with trauma, disabilities, or autism. Our ongoing approach to training will equip you with the knowledge and skills needed to care for children with varying needs.</p>\n<p>Fostering with FCA is also like joining a big family. You’ll have a network of professionals at your fingertips, as well as a community of other like-minded foster parents to share experiences with. From dedicated social work <a href=\"https://www.thefca.co.uk/about-us/support/\">support and therapy services</a> to peer support groups and regular fun events in the community, you’ll realise that when you foster a child with FCA, you’re never alone on your fostering journey.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"text-small-medium\">You’ll receive a generous fostering allowance</span></h3>\n<p>Fostering a child has its challenges, so it’s only right that we reward you for your hard work and dedication.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thefca.co.uk/about-fostering/fostering-agencies-vs-local-authorities/\">Independent fostering agencies</a> (IFAs) pay more than local authorities, but the exact amount you get depends on where you live and the child you’re fostering.</p>\n<p>The allowances cover all the costs of caring for a child, including meals, clothes, bills and presents. You also get a minimum of 14 nights paid respite, which is where the child in your care lives with another foster family while you have a well-earned break.</p>\n<p>There are also additional bonuses for the length of service and hitting fostering milestones. The <a href=\"https://www.thefca.co.uk/allowances/\">fostering allowance</a> also gives you a number of tax exemptions and won’t affect any of your existing benefits.</p>\n                    </div>\n                            </div>\n        \n            </div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div id=\"image-text-block_0aa6c6e70e30e01a658f1bbfe8b55590\" class=\"custom-block image-text-block alignfull image-left has-none-background-color theme-none spacing-top-full spacing-bottom-full width-full\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"content\">\n            <h2>Start your fostering career today</h2>\n<p>We could give you 101 reasons why you should consider a career in foster care and why it is so important, but the main one will always be the fact that you get the chance to transform a child&#8217;s life.</p>\n<p>If you want more information about fostering, download our <a href=\"https://www.thefca.co.uk/guides/fostering-beginners-guide/\">Beginner’s Guide to Fostering a Child handbook</a>.

Together, they have three children of their own two daughters and a son and our proud grandparents to four grandsons.  Before becoming a foster parent, Annette spent 16 years working in a residential home supporting adults with learning disabilities, where she was a deputy manager. Today, her life centres around caring for her foster children and her grandchildren which she finds incredibly rewarding.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"text-small-medium\"><strong><span style=\"color: #e5007e;\">Why foster?</span></strong></span></h3>\n<p>Annette tells us what made her consider fostering “I think I always wanted to be a mum. I come from a big family of ten children, and I’m the fourth eldest, so having a busy household felt natural to me. After having my own children, I still found myself talking about fostering. I always thought that if I had the space and a spare bedroom, I’d love to do it. I admired people who fostered, I just thought it was brilliant.”</p>\n<p>“I never had the fear of ‘how would I give them back?’ If you do a good job, you know that’s part of the role, and you’ve helped a child. When our eldest eventually moved out, we had a spare room. One evening, while my youngest daughter and I were having dinner, she said, <em>“Mammy, all my life I’ve heard you and Daddy talk about fostering. Now we’ve got a spare room what’s stopping you?”</em></p>\n<p>That very night whilst scrolling through Facebook we saw an advert for FCA and clicked on it, that’s how it all started.”</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n                    </div>\n\n                    <div class=\"media\">\n                <img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"625\" height=\"622\" src=\"https://www.thefca.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Annette-Harkin-625x622.jpg\" class=\"attachment-half-width-desktop size-half-width-desktop\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.thefca.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Annette-Harkin-625x622.jpg 625w, https://www.thefca.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Annette-Harkin-365x363.jpg 365w, https://www.thefca.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Annette-Harkin-176x175.jpg 176w, https://www.thefca.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Annette-Harkin-299x298.jpg 299w, https://www.thefca.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Annette-Harkin.jpg 720w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px\" />            </div>\n            </div>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"content-block-block_05381d895d5e2cce135db5370404b2da\" class=\"custom-block content-block alignfull has-none-background-color theme-none spacing-top-none spacing-bottom-half width-full\" data-columns=\"1\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n\n                    <div class=\"content\">\n                <p>For their family, fostering wasn’t a huge shock. “I was a bit nervous at the start, because you never know what challenges you’re going to face,” Annette explains. But their children and wider family were supportive. In fact, fostering runs in the family as Gerry’s brother and his wife are also foster parents, so it wasn’t a big surprise that Annette and Gerry were taking the step themselves.</p>\n<p>One particularly heart-warming story involves a pair of twin boys. FCA called to match one of the twins with Annette and Gerry, while the other had already been matched with Annette’s cousin, who also fosters with FCA. At the time, Annette didn’t realise it was her cousin, though she recognised the family name. Although the cousins had never met and didn’t know they were both fostering with FCA, everything became clear once the connection was made. The boys were then able to meet regularly and form a strong bond. “It’s really brilliant,” Annette says. “My cousin is like a sister now.”</p>\n<h3><span class=\"text-small-medium\" style=\"color: #e5007e;\"><strong>Best fostering moments</strong></span></h3>\n<p>“When I think about some of my best fostering moments, our first foster child will always have a special place in my heart. Being our first, he made a huge impression on us.”  Annette explains.</p>\n<p>“It’s the same with our little girl we have living with us now, watching her grow in confidence, seeing her feel safe enough to be herself, is incredible and that makes everything worthwhile.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>For me, the best moments are seeing the children blossom, seeing their confidence grow, and knowing they feel safe enough to just be themselves. When a child can truly be themselves, without having to put on a front, you know they’re content and happy. That’s what fostering is all about.</p></blockquote>\n<h3><span class=\"text-small-medium\" style=\"color: #e5007e;\"><strong>Support from FCA </strong></span></h3>\n<p>Annette describes the <a href=\"https://www.thefca.co.uk/about-us/support/\">support</a> she has received from FCA as “amazing and outstanding.” She speaks very highly of her supervising social worker, who she feels she can confide in without judgment, gives her the space to express her feelings openly and she is always available if needed.</p>\n<p>“She’s one of the best <a href=\"https://www.thefca.co.uk/about-us/support/social-work-support/\">social workers</a>, she should be cloned,” Annette says.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"text-small-medium\" style=\"color: #e5007e;\"><strong>Suming up her fostering experience </strong></span></h3>\n<p>When Annette reflects on her fostering journey, she describes it as interesting and challenging but above all, it’s the best thing she has ever done.</p>\n<p>“I would have loved to do it years ago,” she says, “but at the time we just didn’t have the space. We didn’t have a spare bedroom.” Even so, she has no doubts that fostering came into her life at exactly the right moment.</p>\n<p>For Annette, fostering has been incredibly rewarding, she has formed strong friendships and become part of a close-knit community of fellow foster parents. One of her favourite parts of fostering is the monthly support group, which she looks forward. She values the opportunity to share experiences, learn from others, and gain fresh perspectives. Hearing how other foster parents approach similar challenges has helped her think differently and broaden her understanding. “It really opens your mind,” she explains.  Ultimately, while the impact on the children is what matters most, Annette says the friendships, family connects and support she’s found through fostering and through FCA have been truly amazing.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"text-small-medium\" style=\"color: #e5007e;\"><strong>What would your advice be to new foster parents?</strong></span></h3>\n<p>“One of the biggest lessons I’ve learned from fostering is not to take things personally. Children who come into your home might say some of the worst things imaginable. Often, they simply don’t know how to express how they’re feeling. It’s important to separate yourself from it, even though it can feel very personal in the moment.  I genuinely enjoy fostering. One thing I’d say to anyone considering it is: absolutely go to the support groups. Honestly, it makes everything so much easier. You learn so much and knowing you’re not alone makes a huge difference.”</p>\n<h3><span class=\"text-small-medium\" style=\"color: #1d57a5;\"><strong>Get in touch today</strong></span></h3>\n<p><a

We took 59 of our Yorkshire and North East young people to The Clifton Park Christmas Adventure in Rotherham on 14<sup>th</sup> December.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The adventure was 90 minutes of firstly collecting a ‘Christmas Spirit Recipe’ which included filling a jar of laughter, decorating a ginger biscuit Christmas tree &#8211; and listening to a story before seeing Santa in his workshop with his very funny dancing pants machine! The experience was very interactive, so everyone enjoyed it! After that it was rides, mini golf, food and Christmas games in the entertainment tent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We received some fantastic feedback from our young people!</p>\n\n\n<div

Only 1 in 3 children and young people aged 3-18 enjoy reading in their free time, and only 1 in 5 read daily.&nbsp;To try and tackle these issues, the Department for Education in collaboration with the National Literacy Trust have nominated 2026 to run a 3rd National Year of Reading campaign, with the theme title of <strong>Go All In.</strong></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-tact-brand-gray-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-51fded64e92d16b8397232412af9212f\" id=\"h-decline-in-reading-for-pleasure-in-children-amp-young-people\">Decline in &#8216;Reading For Pleasure&#8217; in Children &amp; Young People</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A decline in reading can directly impact on academic achievement, mental wellbeing and even future earnings.&nbsp; In the UK, currently 7.1 million adults struggle to read.&nbsp; Research has shown that children who are confident readers by the end of primary school <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/6867d497fe1a249e937cbcdb/Key_Stage_2_attainment_and_lifetime_earnings_reseach_report_-_July_25.pdf\"><strong>can earn £65,000+ more</strong></a> over their lifetime compared to non-readers. Disadvantaged pupils and those with SEND (Special Educational Needs and Disabilities) are also disproportionately affected by this decline in reading.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The National Literacy Trust have released findings from a recent survey focusing on reading for pleasure in children and young people aged 8-18:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Enjoyment:</strong>&nbsp;Just over 1 in 3 (32.7% &#8211; 34.6%) enjoy reading in their free time, a significant drop from previous years.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Daily Reading:</strong>&nbsp;Only about 1 in 5 (18.7%) read something daily for pleasure, a steep decline since 2005.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Age Trends:</strong>&nbsp;Enjoyment drops significantly with age, from over 70% for 5-8 year olds to around 40% for 14-16 year olds.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Gender Gap:</strong>&nbsp;Girls consistently report higher enjoyment, though the gap has narrowed as boys enjoyment fell less sharply than girls.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Socio-economic:</strong>&nbsp;Fewer children receiving free school meals (FSMs) enjoy reading compared to their peers.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-tact-brand-gray-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-ab2a00932429def3735127e583c99abb\" id=\"h-what-is-the-go-all-in-national-year-of-reading-campaign\">What is The &#8216;Go All In&#8217; National Year of Reading campaign?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Go All In</strong> is essentially the theme for the National Year of Reading 2026 campaign. It hasn&#8217;t been a regular annual event; previous campaigns took place in 1998 and 2008. What makes the 2026 initiative so different is that it will be the first to operate in the age of smartphones and AI. With online devices becoming increasingly important to young people, the aim is to promote a love of reading and transform the nation’s reading culture longer term.&nbsp; Specifically, the Go All In campaign aims to encourage young people to read about their hobbies, interests and passions (including music, films, food or sport) using a wide range of different formats to make reading more culturally relevant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Commissioned by the Government, the campaign is part-funded by the Department for Education &#8211; with additional funding and support from organisations such as Arts Council England, the Julia Rausing Trust, the Clore Duffield Foundation, and the Booksellers&#8217; Association.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the National Year of Reading website, &#8220;The ambition is that the National Year of Reading 2026 will make lasting change to the reading habits of the nation to reverse the decline in reading for pleasure and unlock one of the most powerful tools for equity and opportunity: a love of reading that lasts a lifetime.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout 2026, there will be a number of events and activities planned via the Go All In website. You can <strong><a href=\"https://www.goallin.org.uk/join-us\">sign up</a></strong> for regular updates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from the campaign, there has already been a significant investment in school libraries, with £10 million being earmarked to ensure all primary schools have a library.

They also launched the Apprenticeship Academy, and delivered Bitesize sessions for <strong><a href=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/why-tact/connect/what-is-tact-connect/\">Connect</a></strong> members in a variety of careers, employability and education topics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Education service has provided a suite of training across the year to foster carers, staff and schools, including trauma-informed education, Wales Additional Learning Needs, Secondary Trauma &amp; Resilience, Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder and Anti-Racism.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Young people’s educational achievements have surpassed all expectations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In England, TACT had 13 children who took a year 1 phonics check in the 2024 Summer term. Eight passed, with 6 of those gaining very high marks and 2 gaining full marks. Of the 5 children who did not pass, 3 were very close. All of these children have since been provided with a PhonicsPlay subscription and foster carers have been contacted by the England Advisory teacher to offer some advice and support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a Year 14 multiplication check over the 2024 summer term, there were 18 children with recorded scores. 9 achieved full marks, with 13 in total scoring 22 or more out of 25 &#8211; bettering the 2024 national average. Those who did not pass were given free access to Times Table Rockstars, an online programme to practice multiplication tables.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Children who took their Key Stage 2 SATs achieved reading scores <strong>exceeding the national average</strong>, which was excellent news.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/12/Children-learning-in-a-classroom.jpg\" alt=\"Children learning in a classroom\" class=\"wp-image-18830\" style=\"width:800px\" srcset=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/12/Children-learning-in-a-classroom.jpg 1280w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/12/Children-learning-in-a-classroom-300x200.jpg 300w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/12/Children-learning-in-a-classroom-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/12/Children-learning-in-a-classroom-768x512.jpg 768w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/12/Children-learning-in-a-classroom-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Of the young people who took their GCSEs:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>22.7% achieved a grade 4 (a pass) or above in both English and Maths.

TACT were proud to hear that 2 young people got the grades they needed for university; one passed their access course and is going on to study Adult Nursing, and the other achieved BBC A Level grades and took up their place to study Law.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>TACT would like to congratulate all our young people on some wonderful achievements, where resilience and determination have truly paid off. These successes reflect not only individual talent, but also the hard work, perseverance, and positive support across TACT that continues to help our young people thrive.</strong></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/news/educational-achievements-surpass-expectations/\">Educational Achievements For TACT Young People Surpass Expectations</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk\">TACT</a>.</p>",

Here is her story</p>\n<p>After 37 years in the classroom, I was always determined that I would retire as close to my 60<sup>th</sup> birthday as possible.  I wanted to spend my retirement finding out more about life and enjoying new experiences, be it volunteering, learning new skills or travelling.</p>\n<p>I was aware that I would miss the company of young people and the joy of being with them as they grew and discovered the world around them.  I felt I still had skills to offer.  An invitation from the FCA fostering agency to attend an introductory meeting to looked interesting and a warm welcome from the social worker encouraged me to go further.</p>\n                    </div>\n\n                    <div class=\"media\">\n                <img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"625\" height=\"469\" src=\"https://www.thefca.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Alison-Baker-625x469.jpg\" class=\"attachment-half-width-desktop size-half-width-desktop\" alt=\"Alison foster parent FCA South East\" srcset=\"https://www.thefca.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Alison-Baker-625x469.jpg 625w, https://www.thefca.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Alison-Baker-365x274.jpg 365w, https://www.thefca.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Alison-Baker-875x656.jpg 875w, https://www.thefca.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Alison-Baker-176x132.jpg 176w, https://www.thefca.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Alison-Baker-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.thefca.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Alison-Baker-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://www.thefca.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Alison-Baker-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https://www.thefca.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Alison-Baker-397x298.jpg 397w, https://www.thefca.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Alison-Baker-952x714.jpg 952w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px\" />            </div>\n            </div>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"content-block-block_6733c1c7327e7f3590fd5d08cda881c8\" class=\"custom-block content-block alignfull has-none-background-color theme-none spacing-top-none spacing-bottom-half width-full\" data-columns=\"1\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n\n                    <div class=\"content\">\n                <p>I opted for <a href=\"https://www.thefca.co.uk/about-fostering/types-of-fostering/short-term-fostering/\">short term fostering</a>; I welcome children and young people for just a few days or weeks.  In some cases it may only be for 24 hours: I currently welcome a young person every month for an overnight stay.  The reasons why the young people need to come to me vary: it may be because their full-time foster parent is ill, or there is family illness, a bereavement or a holiday was booked before the child came to live with them.</p>\n<p>Since retiring eight years ago I have welcomed around 20 young people aged between 5 and 17.  and have greatly enjoyed being with the children who have stayed with me.  One young man came to me every summer for two weeks from age 11 to 17.  He first appeared as a very shy, nervous boy but grew into a confident adult who was ready to take on the world.  The longest period that a young person stayed with me was an asylum seeker who was with me for 11 months.  I’m an approved parent and child carer and have welcomed two new mothers with their babies for short breaks. There have naturally been one or two challenges, I have learnt how to manage type 1 diabetes and epilepsy, but our training gives us a good basis and the social work team is very supportive.  There are regular support meetings for foster parents and it is always a pleasure to get together.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.thefca.co.uk/about-fostering/how-to-become-a-foster-parent/fostering-panel/\">approval process</a> begins with a short introductory course which is designed to give the prospective foster parent an understanding of what is involved followed by training with and assessment by a social worker.  I found the training to be thorough; it often covered aspects of child development that I wished I had known more about during my career in education.</p>\n<p>I have appreciated the flexibility of being able to say when I could welcome a child and when it was not possible.  This has entirely fit in with my retirement plans and so doesn’t interfere with being able to accept opportunities to enjoy the theatre and cultural life and to take trips abroad.  Information about a child is usually provided in advance and I only agree to welcome children if I am confident that I can offer them a good experience; as it’s just me at home that can be very important.  In addition, the fostering allowance has provided a very welcome top up to my pension.  As a Waspi woman this has been particularly beneficial.</p>\n<p>Becoming a foster parent has been one of the best decisions I have ever made and I can wholeheartedly recommend it.  Spending time with some wonderful young people, having fun with them, listening to them, cooking and gardening with them and laughing with them has helped to make my retirement truly special.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"text-small-medium\"><strong>Get in touch today</strong></span></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thefca.co.uk/enquiry/\">Call our

Households celebrate Christmas in lots of different ways, whilst others do not celebrate it at all. However, as a period of national holiday, it provides many people with the time to take stock and to maybe think about how they can make a meaningful difference in the coming year ahead. For those considering fostering, Christmas can be the perfect catalyst for taking that first step on their fostering journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether it’s the warmth of family gatherings, the spirit of generosity, or the desire for a fresh start, the holiday season can encourage potential foster carers to explore how they can support children who need safe and loving homes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below, we look at three powerful reasons why Christmas is an ideal time to start thinking about becoming a foster carer.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-medium is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"293\" src=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/12/wreath-300x293.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-18705\" style=\"width:150px\" srcset=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/12/wreath-300x293.png 300w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/12/wreath-1024x999.png 1024w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/12/wreath-768x749.png 768w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/12/wreath.png 1280w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-1-christmas-provides-the-time-to-plan-a-new-start\">1. Christmas provides the time to plan a new start</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Christmas period provides a unique opportunity to reflect and evaluate on the past and to set intentions for the coming year. For many people, the festive season is the only time they truly slow down &#8211; whether that be stepping away from work and the usual routines, or just the rush of daily life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This quieter space sometimes prompts us to start thinking about a change of career or direction. If making a difference to other people’s lives is at the root of those thoughts, becoming a foster carer can provide an opportunity to sidestep into a rewarding role without the need for qualifications or previous experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many carers come to fostering from other sectors &#8211; some care-related but others from different sectors altogether. This diversity makes fostering accessible, whilst at the same time establishing a wide pool of foster carers that can be better matched to the needs of vulnerable young people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s important to highlight that fostering is a life-changing decision that the whole household must be on board with. It also involves an assessment process that lasts for several months. This is why the festive season could provide the time for information gathering – and to initiate those household conversations to evaluate whether fostering could be a fresh start for the coming year.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-tact-brand-light-pink-background-color has-background is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-8cf370e7 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-tact-brand-light-pink-background-color has-background is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-8cf370e7 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-9d6595d7 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:50%\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-tact-brand-gray-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-b14d040548ef180f64605a06a88ee26b\" id=\"h-2-christmas-is-a-reminder-of-what-truly-matters-family-and-connections\">2. Christmas Is a Reminder of What Truly Matters: Family and Connections</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The festive season can provide the emotional space to reflect, reconnect, and cherish the relationships that truly matter to us: family and friends.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether it’s gathering around the dinner table, catching up with loved ones we haven’t seen in a while, or simply enjoying the warmth of being together, Christmas reminds us that it’s these connections that enrich our lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, this period of togetherness can also bring to mind those who may not experience the same comfort and stability. Thoughts often turn to vulnerable children &#8211; those who may be facing the festive season without the same sense of family unity, warmth and belonging. While Christmas highlights the joy of connection, it can also shine a light on the children who need it most.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is why many people consider fostering during this time; it’s a gentle reminder that the nurturing family environment that we create at Christmas could have a meaningful impact on children in care.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:2%\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/12/Christmas-meal-1024x800.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-18666\" srcset=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/12/Christmas-meal-1024x800.jpg 1024w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/12/Christmas-meal-300x234.jpg 300w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/12/Christmas-meal-768x600.jpg 768w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/12/Christmas-meal.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-3-christmas-nurtures-generosity-and-compassion\">3. Christmas Nurtures Generosity and Compassion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The festive season is naturally built around kindness. Even if Christmas is not traditionally celebrated in a household it is, along with other religious festivals, a period associated with giving, sharing and thinking of others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a time when communities come together, when small acts of generosity feel more meaningful, and when we’re reminded of the positive impact compassion can have on someone’s life. For many, fostering is one of the most impactful and rewarding ways to truly make a difference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea of offering a stable, nurturing home to a child who needs one resonates deeply during this season, when the values of empathy, connection, and care are at the forefront of our minds. Foster carers provide children with emotional support, guidance, stability, and encouragement. They are generous with their time, and work flexibly to help children heal from past trauma, helping them to build meaningful connections and relationships.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But their impact goes far beyond meeting day-to-day needs; foster carers help children rediscover trust. They offer consistency where there may have been uncertainty, and they provide a sense of belonging that can help shape a child’s entire future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a child who has faced challenges or instability, being welcomed into a home where they feel safe, valued, and listened to can have a profound impact. Moments that might seem simple such as sharing a meal, receiving help with homework or celebrating milestones can be powerful stepping stones towards emotional healing and, eventually, independence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the festive season reminds us of the importance of kindness and community, it also highlights the incredible difference that foster carers make every day. Their compassion helps turn difficult chapters into hopeful new beginnings: something truly worth celebrating at this time of year and beyond.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-tact-brand-light-pink-background-color has-background is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-8cf370e7 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-tact-brand-light-pink-background-color has-background is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-8cf370e7 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-medium is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"271\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/12/A-christmas-tree-271x300.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-18700\" style=\"width:150px\" srcset=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/12/A-christmas-tree-271x300.png 271w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/12/A-christmas-tree-926x1024.png 926w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/12/A-christmas-tree-768x850.png 768w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/12/A-christmas-tree.png 1157w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 271px) 100vw, 271px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-tact-white-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-tact-white-background-color has-background is-style-dots\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center\" id=\"h-why-christmas-is-the-perfect-time-to-consider-fostering\">Why Christmas Is the Perfect Time to Consider Fostering</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">Christmas is more than a holiday. It&#8217;s a time to take a breath and consider a new start for the coming year. A new start that encompasses kindness, family, and truly making a difference in your home and the wider community. These values align perfectly with fostering, making the festive period a natural moment to think about whether you could offer a safe and supportive home to vulnerable children.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-tact-white-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-tact-white-background-color has-background is-style-dots\"/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">Whether becoming a foster carer has been on your mind for a while, or if it’s a relatively new thought &#8211; take the time over the holiday season to consider, reflect and, if relevant, to talk to other members of your household.

      "content": "<p>As parents, we endeavour to raise children who are healthy, happy, and ready to take on the world. Watching them grow into confident young adults and eventually leave the family home is such a natural part of life, but when that day comes, it can stir up a whirlwind of emotions. After years of sharing laughter, teaching life skills, and helping them believe in themselves, the house suddenly feels a little quieter. It is a big change, and adjusting to this new chapter takes time.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Is an Empty Nester?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>An empty nester is a parent whose children have moved out of the family home. Young adults leave for many reasons, such as attending university, starting a career, moving in with a partner, or simply beginning a new chapter in their lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This transition brings a new lease of life for some parents, offering the freedom to try new things and explore new hobbies with their newly found time. However, for others, the change can be emotionally challenging.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Challenges Do Empty Nesters Face?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It is natural for empty nesters to experience feelings of loneliness or uncertainty as the house becomes quieter. The familiar routines that once shaped the day, washing uniforms, cooking meals, supervising homework, being a taxi driver or simply knowing that a child was home safe, are no longer there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many parents find this shift surprisingly emotional. Often called ‘empty nester syndrome’, it can bring sadness, loneliness, and even a sense of grief. Missing the structure, the laughter, and the sense of purpose that once filled the day is common, and adjusting to a quieter home takes time.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Can Fostering Support Empty Nesters?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Even when children grow up and move out, the instinct to support, care for, and guide others often remains strong. Fostering offers a meaningful way to open both your heart and your home to a child or young person who needs stability, understanding and encouragement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fostering is not about replacing grown children. Instead, it brings new purpose and an opportunity to make a meaningful difference in a young life. It allows parents to continue offering warmth, reassurance, and a sense of belonging to children and young people who need it most.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Empty Nesters Make Great Foster Carers</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Empty nesters often make excellent foster carers for many reasons. Years of raising children provide valuable experience in navigating the challenges and milestones of childhood and adolescence. While having children is not a requirement for becoming a foster carer, this experience provides skills that are highly beneficial in caring for a young person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Empty nesters understand the daily responsibilities of parenting and preparing a child for independence in a safe and caring environment, which is the overall goal of fostering. Over the years, they also develop patience, effective communication, problem-solving skills, and emotional understanding, all of which are essential qualities for successful foster carers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Thinking About Becoming a Foster Carer?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The home may feel quieter now, but this next chapter can be filled with connection, purpose, and the joy of making a lasting difference in a child or young person’s life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are thinking about becoming a foster carer or have any questions about how fostering can help fill your empty nest, <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/contact/\">contact our recruitment team</a>, who can answer any questions you have and provide you with information on the excellent <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/fostering/support/\">support</a>, <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/fostering/training/\">training</a> and <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/fostering/fostering-allowance-pay/\">allowance</a> Swiis offers.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/what-are-empty-nesters-and-why-they-make-great-foster-carers/\">What Are Empty Nesters and Why They Make Great Foster Carers</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com\">Swiis Foster Care</a>.</p>",

This is where creating boundaries comes in.</p>\n<p>Boundaries aren’t about discipline and control; they’re about helping children learn to regulate their emotions and build skills that will help them when they reach adulthood.</p>\n<p>For example, if your foster child is getting frustrated about something, you may teach them how to express their emotions in a calm and respectful way. If they don’t learn this skill, it could make it difficult for them to form connections or manage in the workplace as they get older.</p>\n<p>Boundaries are also about creating routines that help children and young people feel safe and stable within the foster home because they know what&#8217;s going to happen and when. This is especially important for children and young people in care who may have experienced multiple moves and lived in households where routines and behaviour were unpredictable.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at the benefits of setting boundaries in more detail.</p>\n\n                            </div>\n        \n            </div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div id=\"image-text-block_d88ebfdec0aa77dd8f93a17be4139968\" class=\"custom-block image-text-block alignfull image-right mobile-image-first has-light-grey-background-color theme-none spacing-top-full spacing-bottom-none width-full\" data-emergence=\"hidden\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"content\">\n            <h2>Benefits of setting <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">boundaries</span></h2>\n<p>Whether you’re a single foster parent or foster with someone else, the benefits of setting boundaries are far-reaching.

When they move into your home, they may continue to do the same. However, when you set consistent and loving boundaries that include routine meals and snacks, they&#8217;ll feel safe enough to let go of this survival habit.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n                            </div>\n        \n                    <div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n                                    <div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n                        <h3><span class=\"text-small-medium\">Teaches children life skills</span></h3>\n<p>Without boundaries, society would be chaos. People could do whatever they wanted without concern for the repercussions because they wouldn&#8217;t exist.</p>\n<p>Society is built on boundaries that help keep people safe and the country going. For example, if you commit a crime, you may be sent to prison or receive a fine because you&#8217;ve overstepped the boundaries of reasonable behaviour.</p>\n<p>If children grow up in homes without boundaries where they can pretty much do whatever they like, they won&#8217;t learn how to function in society as adults. When you set consistent boundaries within your home, you help children learn life skills, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Emotional resilience</strong>: They&#8217;ll learn how to regulate their emotions and use healthy ways to express themselves.</li>\n<li><strong>Accountability</strong>: When you teach a child that their actions have consequences, such as how saying something mean to someone could hurt their feelings, they&#8217;ll learn how to take accountability for their actions.</li>\n<li><strong>Independence</strong>: They&#8217;ll learn how to take care of themselves and hold down a job.</li>\n<li><strong>Self-awareness</strong>: They&#8217;ll become more attuned with themselves, helping them set their own boundaries in relationships and at work to prevent burnout and protect their mental health.</li>\n<li><strong>Social skills</strong>: They&#8217;ll learn how to respect other people&#8217;s personal space, views, and needs while also learning how to voice their own.</li>\n</ul>\n\n                                            </div>\n                                    <div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n                        <h3><span class=\"text-small-medium\">Gives life some order</span></h3>\n<p>As a foster parent, boundaries and routines give your life order, preventing you from becoming overwhelmed and reducing your risk of burnout.</p>\n<p>From meetings and appointments to school drop-offs and family time arrangements, you have a lot to think about. You also need to make time for household chores, visiting loved ones, and just having a little time to yourself.</p>\n<p>Boundaries and routines help you keep your life balanced. For example, if you make it routine for your foster children to go to bed at the same time every night, you&#8217;ll also be allotting time for yourself to watch some TV, read a book, or do an at-home workout.</p>\n<p>You may also need to set boundaries with your friends and family to make sure they don&#8217;t upset your foster child by asking too many questions, popping in unannounced, or behaving in ways that could make them feel unsafe.</p>\n\n                                            </div>\n                            </div>\n            \n                        </div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div id=\"accordion-block_4f016bc17cdc3e93338591c287b51091\" class=\"custom-block accordion-block alignfull has-none-background-color theme-none spacing-top-half spacing-bottom-none width-full\" data-emergence=\"hidden\">\n    \n    <div class=\"container\">\n                    <div class=\"content-container\">\n                                    <h2 style=\"text-align: center;\" aria-level=\"2\"><span class=\"text-medium\" data-contrast=\"none\">How to set healthy boundaries as a <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">foster parent</span></span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134245418&quot;:true,&quot;134245529&quot;:true,&quot;335559738&quot;:160,&quot;335559739&quot;:80}\"> </span></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Now that we&#8217;ve explored the benefits of boundaries, let&#8217;s jump into how to set healthy ones in your foster home.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n                            </div>\n        \n                        <div class=\"accordion-item\">\n                    <div class=\"title\">\n                        <p>Start small and be realistic </p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"content-wrapper\">\n                        <div class=\"content\">\n                            <p>When a child moves into your home, it could be incredibly overwhelming for them if you implement multiple boundaries at the same time. So start small and be realistic about your expectations.</p>\n<p>For example, if you prefer everyone to eat at the table together during mealtimes, but this is a new experience for your foster child, introduce it to them gradually.</p>\n<p>When they first move in, it&#8217;s all about making them feel comfortable, so if they&#8217;re used to eating in front of the TV, do so alongside them. You could then suggest turning the TV off and eating one meal at the table each day until you eventually all sit together for every meal.</p>\n<p>You could also get them involved by asking them to help you lay the table, choose where everyone will sit, or pick a game to play while you&#8217;re eating, so they look forward to sitting down as a family.</p>\n\n                                                    </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                        <div class=\"accordion-item\">\n                    <div class=\"title\">\n                        <p>Make sure they apply to everyone </p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"content-wrapper\">\n                        <div class=\"content\">\n                            <p>If you set a boundary, make sure it applies to every child in the home.

A fun fact about Gareth is that he once taught young people how to drive on a race track at Castle Combe. His dream destinations are Vietnam and Thailand, where he looks forward to immersing himself in the vibrant culture and cuisine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let us explore Gareth’s role as an Education Advisor, where he shares his insights on guiding foster children to unlock their full potential.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Your Role at Swiis Foster Care</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What is your job title, and how long have you worked for Swiis?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“I am the Education Advisor for Midlands and South, and I have been employed with Swiis for nearly 8 years.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“My role also allows me to support our placement support team in organising participation events and attending foster carer support groups to advise on how young people can be supported in their education.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What motivated you to work in foster care?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“I wanted to learn how to support children and young people outside of their school environment, support foster families and help improve their lives inside and outside of school.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What does your role as an Education Advisor entail?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“It is always evolving, however, my main responsibilities are to empower foster carers to support children’s education and outcomes and to ensure all children looked after within our care have the best opportunities to enable them to achieve good outcomes in their education, health and well-being.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What does a day in your role look like?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“A normal day would include discussing issues and concerns that have been raised with other professionals in a multi-agency context, ensuring information to support young people is shared, and to monitor, record and update young people’s progress and to attend education meetings. I am also involved in the participation of events and activities throughout the year.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Where does your department fit in the fostering process?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“Once foster carers are approved, I contact them and offer advice and guidance on how children and young people can be supported in their education. This would include offering guidance concerning policy, children’s rights, school transitions and those young people transitioning to independence, such as university, work and other apprenticeships. Throughout the time the children are with our foster carers, I support and advocate for the children and foster carers.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Fostering Insights</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How do you help provide foster carers with the correct educational support at home?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“Every child has a right to education, but some children who experience care, struggle in education for many reasons, including having to move to new areas on multiple occasions. This often means having to spend the first few days or weeks in the new foster home without education. My role would be to provide the foster carer with the appropriate resources to support the children’s learning, depending on their needs and abilities. Secondary to this, I would work with other agencies and schools to ensure that the most suitable school provision can be sourced, and the young person is given the opportunity to attend school at the earliest opportunity. As well as this being vital for their learning, it is also important for them to make friendships with their peers, appropriate adult relationships with adults and to give them social opportunities within their local community.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How does your role help to support the child in care and their foster carer?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“I would normally introduce myself and explain my role to new foster carers so they are aware of how they can be supported with any educational issues or concerns. Types of support include training in how to advocate for their young people during PEP (Personal Education Plan) and EHCp (Education, Health Care Plan) meetings, advising of their rights and responsibilities, advising foster carers and young people in how to use and access resources that will enhance and support their learning.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What are some of the most memorable achievements you have seen from a child or young person?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“Hearing the feedback from a young unaccompanied person who attended a university experience visit with the Swiis Midlands and South team. They informed me that the day would ‘stay with them forever’ and that it had inspired them to do well in their studies and attend a university in the future. The young person in question has since moved on to further education and is doing very well in his studies.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“Another memorable experience was being with a group of foster children on a day visit to the Donkey Sanctuary and seeing them all play, laugh and eat ice cream together. They loved the day out. This type of event offers children the chance to interact with peers and adults in healthy, supportive environments, helping them learn social and life skills necessary for future independence.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“Also, producing a Podcast with a young person who shared their thoughts and feelings on meaningful topics that affected their lives, such as bullying and identity. The young person felt extremely proud and hoped that it would help other young people. It is essential to provide foster children with a voice for their well-being and development, enabling them to express their emotions and thoughts. It also helps to shape decisions that impact their lives.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What do you think are the best qualities a foster carer should have?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“The best qualities I think a foster carer should have in supporting young people are to show they are interested and invested in helping them with their well-being and safety by listening to them, showing them warmth, being inclusive of their needs and including them as part of the family. By appropriately advocating for their needs when communicating with health, education and social services will also show the young person they are being supported and listened to. The best qualities foster carers can possess are a combination of emotional, practical, and interpersonal abilities.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gareth’s perspective on the educational <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/fostering/support/\">support</a> offered by Swiis highlights our commitment to empowering foster children and young people to achieve academic success.

With the support of her family and Fosterplus, she has built a warm, secure home where her foster daughter has settled, grown in confidence, and found a true sense of belonging.</p>\n                            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"content-block-block_4e8eb56fe6c40e3273d63542896524ff\" class=\"custom-block content-block alignfull has-white-background-color theme-none spacing-top-half spacing-bottom-half width-full\" data-columns=\"1\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n\n                    <div class=\"content\">\n                <h3><strong>Fostering as a single carer later on in life</strong></h3>\n<p>When Alison, from Paisley, welcomed her foster daughter into her home, she was stepping into something she had carried in her heart since childhood. “When I was young, a family friend fostered a wee boy,” she remembers. “It stuck with me for years. <strong>I always thought, </strong><em><strong>one day, I’ll do that too</strong>.</em>”</p>\n<p>Life passed, she raised her own family, and the years went by. Still, the thought never left her. And then, in her early 60s, she decided <em>it’s now or never</em>.</p>\n<p>Despite knowing what she wanted, Alison battled the same worries many people feel when they consider fostering later in life. “Honestly, I thought I might be too old,” she admits. “And I wasn’t sure if being a <a href=\"https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/about-fostering/who-can-foster/can-single-people-foster/\">single foster parent</a> would go against me. I thought, <em>will they even consider me?</em>”</p>\n<p>But one phone call changed everything. “I looked Fosterplus up in the phone book because it was close by,” she laughs. “I didn’t know much about fostering at all. But the moment I spoke to them, I felt reassured. <strong>My age wasn’t an issue — far from it. And there were so many single foster carers. I realised I had talked myself out of something I was absolutely able to do.</strong>”</p>\n<p>That early reassurance shaped the rest of her journey. <strong>“The process was clear and supportive from the start. It made me believe I could do it</strong>.”</p>\n\n                            </div>\n        \n            </div>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"cta-banner-block-block_0fb29dcb7562ab1f1a96d7d26b075207\" class=\"custom-block cta-banner-block alignfull has-dark-blue-background-color has-dark-background theme-none spacing-top-half spacing-bottom-half width-full text-align-right\">\n    \n    <div class=\"container cta-banner-columns\">\n        \n        <div class=\"content\">\n            <h3><span class=\"sub-heading\"><strong><span class=\"text-colour-blue\"><span class=\"text-medium\">Who can foster</span></span></strong></span></h3>\n<p><span class=\"text-small-medium\">Discover everything you need to know about who can foster and what the requirements to fostering are.</span></p>\n        </div>\n\n                    <div class=\"wp-block-buttons is-layout-flex wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex\">\n                                    <div class=\"wp-block-button \">\n                        <a class=\"wp-block-button__link wp-element-button\"  rel='noopener' target='_blank' href=\"https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/about-fostering/who-can-foster/\">\n                            Who can foster                         </a>\n                    </div>\n                            </div>\n            </div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div id=\"image-text-block_864efd6b0c3edbf382efb959678f2d27\" class=\"custom-block image-text-block alignfull image-right mobile-image-first has-none-background-color theme-multiple-misshapen-circles spacing-top-half spacing-bottom-half width-full\" data-emergence=\"hidden\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"content\">\n            <h3><strong>The power of family, even when you’re a single carer</strong></h3>\n<p>Some people imagine that fostering alone means doing everything alone, but Alison’s story shows a very different picture.</p>\n<p><strong>“I might be a single carer, but I’m never on my own,” she says. “My family and friends have been amazing. And Fosterplus are always there when I need them.”</strong></p>\n<p>Her supervising social worker is her first phone call whenever she needs guidance, reassurance, or just a listening ear. “I just lift the phone. And if she doesn’t answer, she calls me right back. I always feel heard. That support means everything.”</p>\n<p>But the most beautiful part of Alison’s support network is her wider family. “My foster daughter sees them as her family. She’s included in everything, birthdays, get-togethers, wee weekends away. We’ve got caravans near each other, so she’s part of all our adventures. She’s never treated differently.”</p>\n<p>That sense of belonging has helped her foster daughter develop confidence and security. <strong>“She knows she’s one of us. That makes such a difference.”</strong></p>\n                    </div>\n\n                    <div class=\"media\">\n                <div class=\"img-wrapper\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"625\" height=\"438\" src=\"https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Alison-e1764247229370-625x438.jpg\" class=\"attachment-half-width-desktop size-half-width-desktop\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Alison-e1764247229370-625x438.jpg 625w, https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Alison-e1764247229370-365x256.jpg 365w, https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Alison-e1764247229370-176x123.jpg 176w, https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Alison-e1764247229370.jpg 670w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px\" /></div>\n            </div>\n            </div>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"content-block-block_7d1b2cc9a3963813ff291099497adc77\" class=\"custom-block content-block alignfull has-light-grey-background-color theme-none spacing-top-half spacing-bottom-half width-full\" data-columns=\"1\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n\n                    <div class=\"content\">\n                <h3><strong>Creating a home where a young person can feel safe enough to grow</strong></h3>\n<p>When Alison’s foster daughter arrived, life felt uncertain and frightening for her. She was nervous, unsure, and didn’t know who to trust. She’d survived some difficult experiences and needed time, consistency and a lot of patience.</p>\n<p>For Alison, this meant creating routines, making daily life predictable, and showing her foster daughter that she was safe. “I treated her the same way I treated my own children. She saw her room, her space, and from day one I introduced her to my family. I wanted her to feel part of something.”</p>\n<p>Little by little, things began to shift and her confidence grew. She smiled more and let Alison  in. One of Alison’s proudest moments is seeing the secure attachment her foster daughter has formed after living with trauma. <strong>“When she came to me, relationships were overwhelming for her. Trust was scary. Now she has that attachment. That’s huge. That’s the achievement I’m most proud of.”</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n                            </div>\n        \n            </div>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"content-block-block_9775b9f58344df775954152097fb4729\" class=\"custom-block content-block alignfull has-none-background-color theme-none spacing-top-half spacing-bottom-half width-full\" data-columns=\"1\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n\n                    <div class=\"content\">\n                <h3><strong>Everyday life and the joy of raising a teenager</strong></h3>\n<p>Fostering isn’t one big moment, it’s hundreds of small ones that build a life together. A typical day for Alison is full and steady, from the school run, shopping and preparing dinner to clubs and activities, a chat before bed and a tablet and a wind-down routine.</p>\n<p><strong>“<a href=\"https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/about-fostering/types-of-fostering/fostering-teenagers/\">Teenagers are all different</a>,” she explains. “You need patience. But they’re also funny, clever, and full of surprises. It’s so rewarding watching them become themselves.”</strong></p>\n<p>Even celebrations are meaningful, especially Christmas. Alison does all the traditions, Christmas Eve boxes, games, the whole family round. “She absolutely loves it.” These traditions have helped her foster daughter understand what family can feel like.</p>\n<p>When asked if there was a moment that made her realise how much she’d impacted her foster daughter’s life, Alison pauses, emotional.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #1d57a5;\">“<strong>When she first came, she was scared and uncertain, now, she calls this home.

I’m patient. I’m kind. And I’m loving. I didn’t think I had all of that in me, but I do.” She’s proof that life experience, stability, empathy, and warmth are some of the greatest gifts a foster parent can offer and at any age.</p>\n<p>Although her foster daughter is still with her, Alison knows that their bond will last long after adulthood. “I think when she grows up, she’ll look back and know how much she was loved. And we’ll stay close — always. That bond doesn’t go away.”</p>\n<h3><strong>Her message to anyone wondering if they’re ‘too old’ or ‘too on their own’</strong></h3>\n<p>Alison’s answer is simple: <span style=\"color: #1d57a5;\"><strong>“Do it.

Christmas may not be celebrated or acknowledged by members of the household, or there may be more deep-routed issues such as negative past experiences from the perspective of a young person. Whatever the reason, the holiday season can work for all members of the fostering household with a little forward planning and flexibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-left has-tact-brand-gray-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-205c09c007ba41638f0d92f1418ccd30\" id=\"h-differences-in-faith-when-fostering-at-christmas\">Differences in faith When Fostering At Christmas</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">One of the most important points to consider when we reach the holiday period is the <strong>differences in faith</strong>. If you are a foster carer who doesn’t celebrate or acknowledge Christmas, then providing a festive experience for a child who values Christmas may feel a little alien to you. Likewise, you may need to provide care to a child whose religion or upbringing is incongruous to Christian festivals such as Christmas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">In these situations, a flexible approach is the key to ensuring that all faiths are represented and celebrated. A great way to achieve this is for both foster carer and child to talk about and introduce elements of their own religions into the festive season. Not only will this achieve a balance between the differing faiths, it will also function as a useful learning and bonding exercise. Social Workers will be able to support with opening these dialogues, and will be able to provide advice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\" style=\"font-size:24px\"><strong><strong>Here are our top five tips for any fostering households who will be looking to celebrate Christmas with the children in their care:</strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-tact-brand-gray-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-9e895adf2a5678bf14ebfc21b0599730\" id=\"h-1-acknowledge-that-smaller-gestures-can-matter-more\">1. Acknowledge that smaller gestures Can matter more</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As a foster carer, it’s natural to want Christmas to feel magical for the children in your care. You want them to have amazing experiences that they will remember and cherish, but this can inadvertently place a lot of pressure on children to enjoy the festive period in a particular way. This can be especially true if a particular young person has never spent Christmas with you before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a young person to come into seasonal visitors, tree presents, elaborate mealtimes and family games can mean that they become overwhelmed and alienated. For some young people, Christmas may be linked with confusion, family conflict, grief, or past trauma. There may be some anxieties around not knowing what to expect, or they may struggle with sensory overload. However, this does not mean that you should immediately cancel all your festive plans and avoid celebrating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best approach is to talk to your social worker beforehand, to get an idea of how the young person perceives Christmas. It could be that scaling back some plans, and placing more importance on talking and spending physical time with them may be better for their mental health and wellbeing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Smaller and quieter acts of consistency and care can go a long way to reassure a young person that they are safe, valued, and genuinely included. Ultimately, these gentle moments often matter far more than any big event or elaborate celebration, helping them feel truly at home during the festive season.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-tact-brand-light-blue-background-color has-background is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-8cf370e7 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-tact-brand-light-blue-background-color has-background is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-8cf370e7 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-9d6595d7 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:50%\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-tact-brand-gray-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-0e59175af2dad968c3ed18e8b5d726e3\" id=\"h-2-be-flexible-with-your-christmas-traditions\">2. Be Flexible With Your Christmas Traditions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For many people, traditions are a big part of Christmas time. Perhaps Christmas Day usually begins with the opening of presents, followed by a big festive lunch, silly party hats, tree presents, and an afternoon packed with games and laughter. These traditions can feel natural and familiar to you &#8211; but for a young person in foster care, they may be entirely new, or their past experiences of Christmas may look very different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s why flexibility is key.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before the celebrations begin, take some time to talk to the young person about what Christmas means to them. Ask about any traditions they enjoy, the foods they like, or the activities they’d feel comfortable taking part in. You might be surprised by the small but meaningful things that matter to them &#8211; something as simple as watching a certain film, baking together, or choosing a decoration for the tree can help them feel grounded and included.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where possible, incorporate their ideas into your festive plans. This not only helps them feel seen and valued, but also reassures them that their preferences matter within your household. Involving them in planning activities, deciding the day’s order, or preparing the home for Christmas can also build a sense of belonging and a shared ownership of the Christmas period.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By staying open and flexible, you’re creating a Christmas that isn’t just built around tradition, but built around the young person who is sharing the season with you. And often, those small adjustments can transform the holidays into a time that feels safe, inclusive, and truly special for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read more about <strong><a href=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/christmas-traditions-fostering/\">Christmas traditions in a fostering household</a></strong>.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:2%\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"682\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/12/Christmas-tree-682x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-18650\" srcset=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/12/Christmas-tree-682x1024.jpg 682w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/12/Christmas-tree-200x300.jpg 200w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/12/Christmas-tree-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/12/Christmas-tree.jpg 853w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 682px) 100vw, 682px\" /></figure>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-tact-brand-gray-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-b867a0c94fd2496f761b5a3d16b37c20\" id=\"h-3-try-and-avoid-moments-that-could-be-activating\">3. Try and avoid moments that could be &#8216;activating&#8217;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Christmas is often portrayed as a joyful, carefree time of year. However, for many fostered children, the festive season can bring up emotions that are far more complex. It’s important for foster carers to recognise that, beneath the surface, Christmas can activate emotions that could affect a young person’s mood, behaviour, and sense of safety.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For some children, Christmas is linked to difficult or traumatic memories. The sights, sounds, and routines associated with the season, such as large gatherings, loud celebrations, or even particular foods or songs, might remind them of past experiences that were unsettling or unsafe. These reminders can stir up anxiety and emotional distress, leading to instances of withdrawal or unexpected behaviour. In many circumstances, the young person may not be able to explain why Christmas is affecting them in this way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For others, the opposite can be true; a young person may have had warm, happy Christmas experiences with their birth family, and the absence of familiar people or traditions can feel deeply painful. Even positive memories can evoke grief, longing, or confusion, leaving them feeling unsettled during what appears outwardly to be a cheerful time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever the nature of these emotional activations are, recognising them early is key.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes, directly asking the young person about their Christmas experiences isn’t appropriate; they may not feel ready to talk, or they may not fully understand their own reactions. Instead, speak with your supervising social worker or the young person’s allocated worker. They can share any known information about past experiences, sensitivities, or specific scenarios to help you prepare thoughtfully.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With this insight, you can make gentle, informed plans that either avoid certain activating situations or reduce their impact. This might involve adjusting certain traditions, simplifying busy days, creating quiet spaces for downtime, or offering predictable routines to help them feel safe and grounded.

Take a calm and steady approach to Fostering At Christmas</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever your Christmas plans look like &#8211; whether you prefer a busy house full of visitors or a quieter celebration &#8211; it’s important to remember that the festive period often means everyone is under the same roof for longer than usual. Even in the most settled households, this can create moments of tension or stress. For children in care who may already feel uncertain or emotionally heightened at this time of year, the intensity of the holidays can be particularly challenging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adopting a calm, steady approach can make a huge difference. It may seem like simple advice, but creating an environment where the pace is gentle, the expectations are realistic, and everyone has access to personal space is often essential for supporting good mental health and wellbeing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Children and young people in care may be especially sensitive to noise, unpredictability, or crowded spaces. Christmas can bring all of these at once. By planning ahead and intentionally building in periods of calm, you offer them the chance to decompress and regulate their emotions before things become overwhelming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This could mean:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Spreading out activities over several days instead of doing everything at once</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Allowing downtime between social events, meals, or visits</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Creating a quiet room or cosy corner where they can retreat if they need space</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Keeping routines as predictable as possible</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Letting them know in advance what the day will look like, so there are no surprises</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>By leading with calmness, you will help set the emotional tone for the household. This not only supports the young person in your care but also protects your own wellbeing during what can be a very busy time. Sometimes, it’s these quieter, more peaceful moments that become the most meaningful part of the festive season.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-tact-brand-light-blue-background-color has-background is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-8cf370e7 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-tact-brand-light-blue-background-color has-background is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-8cf370e7 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta is-style-rtl\">\n\t<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta__inner\">\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta__left\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta__image\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"image-bubble\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2024/09/Kayleigh-e1764084162528.jpg\" alt=\"Kayleigh is an Innovation and Continuous Improvement Manager\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"quote-bubble\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<svg width=\"164\" height=\"144\" viewBox=\"0 0 164 144\" fill=\"none\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<path d=\"M33.4844 9.58621C61.8844 -8.81379 93.5 3.92638 109.484 9.58621C184.5 38.9263 175.484 121.086 118.984 138.586C62.4844 156.086 26.9844 122.086 9.48441 88.0863C-8.01559 54.0863 -2.01559 32.5862 33.4844 9.58621Z\" fill=\"white\"/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<path d=\"M90.7797 94.5568C80.2697 82.8104 87.4825 62.2025 96.3438 54.3716C103.763 47.571 116.127 42.0069 117.364 44.0677C119.218 47.1588 112.006 49.2196 106.442 54.1655C99.6411 61.5843 97.3742 64.8816 106.854 69.0031C116.952 73.5369 117.158 78.0706 117.57 83.8408C118.188 98.0602 101.084 104.655 90.7797 94.5568Z\" fill=\"#E11F8F\"/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<path d=\"M51.2119 94.3504C40.7019 82.604 47.9146 61.9961 56.776 54.1652C64.1948 47.3646 76.5595 41.8005 77.796 43.8613C79.6507 46.9524 72.438 49.0133 66.8738 53.9592C60.0733 61.378 57.8064 64.6752 67.286 68.7967C77.3838 73.3305 77.5899 77.8642 78.0021 83.6344C78.6203 97.8538 61.5158 104.448 51.2119 94.3504Z\" fill=\"#E11F8F\"/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</svg>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta__right\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"acf-innerblocks-container\">\n\n<p style=\"font-size:24px\">&#8220;Christmas can be a time of healing and connection.

Try to avoid conditional language</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many adults use conditional language with young people as a way of teaching cause and effect. It’s something most young people have heard at some point growing up, with phrases such as &#8216;if you tidy your room, then you can have a treat&#8217;, or &#8216;if you study, you will pass your exams&#8217;. These statements are familiar, well-intentioned, and often said without a second thought.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, for children and young people who have experienced trauma, neglect, or inconsistent care, conditional language can be confusing, anxiety-provoking, or even damaging. Additionally, some young people may struggle with vague phrases such as &#8216;being good&#8217;, which is not to say that they themselves are badly behaved.  In these cases, using conditional language can create unrealistic and unattainable expectations on young people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When fostering at Christmas, this becomes especially important. Phrases like &#8216;if you’re good, you’ll get some presents&#8217; may seem harmless &#8211; but for a young person in care they can create a fear of failure, and worries that they might somehow lose their gifts, or your approval. The child may also interpret the condition in extreme or distorted ways due to past experiences and trauma.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A more supportive and trauma-informed approach is to remove conditions altogether.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let the young person know &#8211; through both your words and your actions &#8211; that Christmas gifts, treats, and shared moments are freely given. They don’t need to earn them. They don’t have to perform or behave in a specific way to be worthy of kindness or celebration. This helps reinforce a powerful, healing message: <strong>they deserve care and joy simply because they are who they are.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>By doing this, you may also be gently unpicking old belief systems that were formed during difficult times in their lives. Showing unconditional warmth and reliability helps build trust, strengthens your relationship, and creates a sense of emotional safety during a season that can otherwise be confusing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The key point to remember when fostering at Christmas is that support is always available over the festive period, whether that be via your social worker, or a dedicated out-of-hours service.

You show your grandchildren what it really means to be kind and selfless by opening your home to the children and young people who need it most.</p>\n<p>This will give your grandchildren a foundation to develop these personal qualities too. They&#8217;ll learn how to see things from other people&#8217;s perspectives and begin to understand that everyone&#8217;s experience of the world is unique.</p>\n<p>As a result, they&#8217;ll be able to build meaningful relationships with people from all walks of life as they grow up to be kind, caring and compassionate individuals.</p>\n\n                                                    </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                        <div class=\"accordion-item\">\n                    <div class=\"title\">\n                        <p>Building friendships</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"content-wrapper\">\n                        <div class=\"content\">\n                            <p>Your foster children will become part of your family, which means your grandchildren will spend time with them.

But what&#8217;s even more special about the relationship between your grandchildren and foster children is that they&#8217;ll share a sense of belonging to the same family, which is unlikely to happen with their peers.</p>\n<p>For example, you may spend Christmas Day together or go on holiday as a family. They&#8217;ll also both understand family traditions, in-jokes, and personality quirks. This can lead to a stronger bond, similar to sibling or cousin relationships, helping them remain closer for longer and possibly even for the rest of their lives.</p>\n\n                                                    </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div id=\"accordion-block_c1a5e5256d5bc6b3e767b909b1c8bcdc\" class=\"custom-block accordion-block alignfull has-light-grey-background-color theme-none spacing-top-full spacing-bottom-full width-full\" data-emergence=\"hidden\">\n    \n    <div class=\"container\">\n                    <div class=\"content-container\">\n                                    <h3>3 Challenges of fostering with <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">grandchildren</span></h3>\n<p>Now that we&#8217;ve explored just a handful of the benefits of fostering with grandchildren, let&#8217;s look at three common challenges and how to build strong relationships with grandchildren while overcoming them.</p>\n                            </div>\n        \n                        <div class=\"accordion-item\">\n                    <div class=\"title\">\n                        <p>Sharing your time and attention </p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"content-wrapper\">\n                        <div class=\"content\">\n                            <p>Fostering is a full-time role. From school runs and family time arrangements to ongoing training and support groups, there&#8217;s never a dull moment. However, this means that if you have grandchildren, you&#8217;ll have to find a way to balance your time so you can still nurture your bond and prevent them from feeling left out. Here are a few things you can do to help:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Discuss fostering with your grandchildren so they know what it means and what to expect. Having an awareness of why children need foster care could promote empathy and prevent jealousy.</li>\n<li>Reassure your grandchildren that your love for them will never change and you&#8217;ll always be there for them.</li>\n<li>Get them involved by helping them make a welcome banner or card for when your foster child arrives.</li>\n<li>Include them by inviting them to days out, or to your house for a nice meal together as a family.</li>\n<li>Schedule one-on-one time. If you can&#8217;t commit to regular meetups, you could FaceTime once a week instead.</li>\n<li>Let them know that they&#8217;re always on your mind by sending them a little message or small gifts from time to time.</li>\n</ul>\n\n                                                    </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                        <div class=\"accordion-item\">\n                    <div class=\"title\">\n                        <p>Understanding boundaries  </p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"content-wrapper\">\n                        <div class=\"content\">\n                            <p>Children like to ask questions and push the boundaries. For example, your grandchildren might ask you or your foster child why they&#8217;re in care. They may also not understand why they shouldn&#8217;t go into your foster child&#8217;s bedroom.</p>\n<p>Before you welcome a child home, it&#8217;s a good idea to talk to your adult children and grandchildren about boundaries when you have a foster child in your care. This can prevent any misunderstandings or hurt feelings when your foster child arrives and everyone is getting to know each other.</p>\n<p>You could even agree on a code word that you&#8217;ll use to let them know they&#8217;re pushing the boundaries a little too far. This could help you avoid causing a scene, which could upset both your grandchildren and the child in your care.</p>\n\n                                                    </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                        <div class=\"accordion-item\">\n                    <div class=\"title\">\n                        <p>Behavioural differences</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"content-wrapper\">\n                        <div class=\"content\">\n                            <p>Children in care are often living with the trauma of their past experiences, which means they could behave in a way that confuses your grandchildren.</p>\n<p>For example, your grandchild may innocently touch one of your foster child&#8217;s belongings, but your foster child&#8217;s trauma could mean they see this as a threat. As a result, they may display big emotions about something that seems trivial to your grandchild.</p>\n<p>You can help your foster child and grandchild in situations like this by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Staying calm and taking time to respond to the situation to avoid upsetting the children further.</li>\n<li>Acknowledging both children&#8217;s feelings.</li>\n<li>Explaining to your grandchild that when someone has had difficult experiences, they might get upset about things that seem small to us, but feel big to them.</li>\n<li>Reinforce boundaries about touching your foster child&#8217;s belongings to your grandchild.</li>\n<li>Reassure your foster child that their belongings are safe and your grandchild won&#8217;t do it again.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By responding in this way, you help your grandchild understand the impacts of trauma on behaviour while also ensuring your foster child continues to feel safe and secure in your home.</p>\n\n                                                    </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"content-block-block_98922a957616ffcd820c14918d72e0f6\" class=\"custom-block content-block alignfull has-none-background-color theme-none spacing-top-full spacing-bottom-none width-full\" data-columns=\"1\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n\n                    <div class=\"content\">\n                <h2 aria-level=\"2\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Supporting your <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">whole family </span></span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134245418&quot;:true,&quot;134245529&quot;:true,&quot;335559738&quot;:160,&quot;335559739&quot;:80}\"> </span></h2>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">As a grandparent, fostering can be a rewarding journey for both you and your grandchildren.

Feeling inspired, they decided to take that leap and <a href=\"#contact\">apply to become foster parents</a>.</p>\n<p>They felt nervous but excited about starting their journey. Lisa explained “<em>you don&#8217;t know what to expect when you first go into it.” </em></p>\n\n                            </div>\n        \n            </div>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"content-block-block_7cb5e7126f7cc6b0d650286fe196aefe\" class=\"custom-block content-block alignfull has-white-background-color theme-none spacing-top-half spacing-bottom-half width-full\" data-columns=\"1\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n\n                    <div class=\"content\">\n                <h2><span class=\"text-medium\"><strong>Transferring to Fosterplus</strong></span></h2>\n<p>After starting their fostering journey with another independent fostering agency, Lisa and Andy realised they weren’t getting the level of support they needed. <a href=\"https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/about-us/support/\">Support</a> is one of the most important things in fostering and receiving the right support from an agency will determine the success of your journey, and be the difference in ensuring a positive experience for your family and the children you care for.</p>\n<p>“<em>We wanted to <a href=\"https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/transfer-to-us/\">transfer fostering agency</a> because we weren&#8217;t feeling fully supported. <strong>Since we moved to Fosterplus, we have had so much more support. We couldn’t have asked for more</strong>.</em></p>\n<p><em>We’ve been in situations previously where if I was to call our social worker at 4:50, they won’t answer. But at Fosterplus it was no problem whatsoever – any times there was an emergency, we phoned up and they supported us all the way through.”</em></p>\n<p>Andy explained their reasons for choosing to transfer to Fosterplus:</p>\n<p><em>“We chose to move to Fosterplus because they were open and honest answering the questions I asked them. You’ve got to be able to speak openly, and we thought ‘they have been honest with us – <strong>this is the agency for us</strong>’.</em></p>\n<p><em>And you need that team around you, to support you, in order to be able to look after the children. We&#8217;ve been fully supported since we came to the agency. It&#8217;s completely different; like chalk and cheese.”</em></p>\n<p>Another key area to look at when choosing a fostering agency to transfer to, is consistency and stability. Whether that is the stability and long-term difference of the foster care placements, committed teams who will stand by you, or the foster parents choosing to foster for many years – longevity tells an important story.</p>\n<p>Andy explained: “<em>At a lot of other agencies, people leave, so there&#8217;s always a change of people, which is not consistent for the children. <strong>We’ve had the same staff since we joined. All the way through. It&#8217;s very good. Retention at Fosterplus is fantastic – because people want to stay</strong>.”</em></p>\n\n                            </div>\n        \n            </div>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"cta-banner-block-block_abe97a9f868861e8632484e2b3444c2e\" class=\"custom-block cta-banner-block alignfull has-dark-blue-background-color has-dark-background theme-none spacing-top-half spacing-bottom-half width-full text-align-right\">\n    \n    <div class=\"container cta-banner-columns\">\n        \n        <div class=\"content\">\n            <p><span class=\"sub-heading\"><strong><span class=\"text-colour-blue\"><span class=\"text-medium\">Download our Guide to Transferring</span></span></strong></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"text-small-medium\">Discover everything you need to know about the process of transferring fostering agency in our free guide.</span></p>\n        </div>\n\n                    <div class=\"wp-block-buttons is-layout-flex wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex\">\n                                    <div class=\"wp-block-button \">\n                        <a class=\"wp-block-button__link wp-element-button\"  rel='noopener' target='_blank' href=\"https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/guide-to-transferring/\">\n                            Download Transfer Guide                        </a>\n                    </div>\n                            </div>\n            </div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div id=\"image-text-block_ff19e926020f8b211a5b9802e2888bfa\" class=\"custom-block image-text-block alignfull image-right mobile-image-first has-none-background-color theme-multiple-misshapen-circles spacing-top-half spacing-bottom-half width-full\" data-emergence=\"hidden\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"content\">\n            <h2><span class=\"text-medium\"><strong>The difference long-term fostering makes</strong></span></h2>\n<p>For Lisa and Andy, <a href=\"https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/about-fostering/types-of-fostering/long-term-permanence/\">long-term fostering</a> has been the most rewarding part of their journey. They’ve seen first-hand how a secure, loving home can change a child’s life.</p>\n<p>Lisa shared: <em>“The benefits of fostering long terms are in how much the boys have changed and developed over time. <strong>They&#8217;re not the same children as when they came to us. Having been through so much, to come as far as they have, it’s amazing</strong>.”</em></p>\n<p><em>“It&#8217;s all the joy you can get from the children – Just having the children around you and seeing how much they can change when they&#8217;ve had such a terrible time in the past. But by giving them that love, support and encouragement, they can succeed, they just need someone to give them that chance to show what they can do.”</em></p>\n<p>Caring for children on a long-term basis helps them to feel more settled in the family, and it provides that real sense of security that they need.</p>\n<p>Lisa added: <em>“There’s a definite, sense of permanence. We refer to them as our boys, and they call us ‘mum and dad’.</em></p>\n<p><em>“It was my birthday last week, and the youngest wrote me a card. It said <strong>‘thank you for everything you have done. I am so happy that you are my mum’</strong>. And it was just amazing.&#8221;</em></p>\n                    </div>\n\n                    <div class=\"media\">\n                <div class=\"img-wrapper\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"625\" height=\"352\" src=\"https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Fosterplus-Lisa-and-Andy-625x352.jpg\" class=\"attachment-half-width-desktop size-half-width-desktop\" alt=\"Transferring_foster_agency\" srcset=\"https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Fosterplus-Lisa-and-Andy-625x352.jpg 625w, https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Fosterplus-Lisa-and-Andy-365x205.jpg 365w, https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Fosterplus-Lisa-and-Andy-875x492.jpg 875w, https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Fosterplus-Lisa-and-Andy-176x99.jpg 176w, https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Fosterplus-Lisa-and-Andy-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Fosterplus-Lisa-and-Andy-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Fosterplus-Lisa-and-Andy-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Fosterplus-Lisa-and-Andy-952x536.jpg 952w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px\" /></div>\n            </div>\n            </div>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"content-block-block_ec3319576aa639ea24a2a5aeae25d5b1\" class=\"custom-block content-block alignfull has-light-grey-background-color theme-none spacing-top-half spacing-bottom-half width-full\" data-columns=\"1\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n\n                    <div class=\"content\">\n                <h2><span class=\"text-medium\"><strong>The importance of support</strong></span></h2>\n<p>One of the biggest changes Lisa and Andy noticed after transferring to Fosterplus was the presence of reliable and responsive support.</p>\n<p>Lisa reflected on the support the couple receive from the agency: <em>“We always receive lots of support from Fosterplus.

It is hard work. You have different things to deal with. Lots of different people coming in and out of your house. But it&#8217;s the children that make it so special.

Over six years later, she shares how fostering a teenager with Fosterplus transformed both of their lives—and why age or relationship status should never stop someone from opening their heart and home to a child in care.</p>\n\n                                    </div>\n                                    <div class=\"post-link\">\n                                        <span class=\"custom-text-link\"><span>Find Out More</span></span>\n                                    </div>\n                                </a>\n                            </article>\n                        </div>\n                                            <div class=\"swiper-slide\">\n                            <article id=\"post-2709\" class=\"post-2709 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-case-studies tag-scotland\">\n                                <a href=\"https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/resources/news-blogs/case-studies/single-foster-dad-brendan/\">\n                                    <div class=\"post-image\">\n                                                                                    <img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"397\" height=\"298\" src=\"https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Fosterplus-Scotland-Brendan-397x298.jpg\" class=\"attachment-page-card-3-col size-page-card-3-col wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" />                                                                                <div class=\"entry-meta\">\n                                            <span class=\"published-date\">September 2 2025</span>\n                                        </div>\n                                    </div>\n                                    <div class=\"post-content\">\n                                        <h3>Thriving as a Single Foster Dad: Brendan’s Story</h3>\n                                        <p>Brendan began fostering when he was just 26 years old.

In our <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/locations/yorkshire/\">Yorkshire</a> region, a group of musically talented individuals known as the Swiis Superstars have come together to create their very first original music track called ‘Our Moments’!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the lead-up to their production day, the young people dedicated time to planning, collaborating, and bringing their ideas to life. The group decided that their song would focus on growing up in foster care, and each young person played an important part in the creative process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One young person, J, a talented lyricist and rapper, wrote the lyrics by drawing inspiration from his own experience in foster care. Alison, a Swiis Senior Placement Support Worker, said, <em>“The speed at which J was able to put the words together was incredible!”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the lyrics were complete, R began experimenting with different sounds on a guitar to complement J’s words. After the group agreed on the perfect sound, E added in additional guitar tones, while P and S helped to create the beats, and PB added rhythm through their impressive beatboxing skills.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the Swiis young people, G, also played a big part in creating the song and was eager to use their talent on the vocals. Unfortunately, they were not able to attend on production day, but we are really looking forward to hearing their musical talent in the future!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When production day arrived, the Swiis local office was transformed into a lively recording studio, giving everyone the perfect space to come together and create their brand-new track.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the song was complete, the group also wanted to create a cover for their track. They chose a dragon to symbolise courage, and one of our talented young people brought that vision to life by mocking up a design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are incredibly proud of the Swiis Superstars for their teamwork and creativity throughout this project. They have such great passion and talent for music and have created a track to be proud of, and we are thrilled to share it with you!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Our Moment - Swiis Superstars\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Sx6aT5bKIOk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/swiis-superstars-release-their-first-music-track/\">Swiis Superstars Release Their First Music Track</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com\">Swiis Foster Care</a>.</p>",

With over 100 young people, foster carers and staff in attendance, the event was a celebration of achievement and connection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our young person’s award was accepted on their behalf by their foster carer, Steven &#8211; who was incredibly proud to see their efforts recognised. Reflecting on the achievement, Steven said: “Being recognised certainly gives him a good sense of self and improves his self-esteem. It also promotes his continual development by assuring him that his efforts are recognised.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“He has always received positive recognition and praise where appropriate from TACT and ourselves, so it will ‘top up’ his sense of achievement.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"641\" src=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/11/TACT-foster-carer-Steven-accepting-an-award-1024x641.jpg\" alt=\"TACT foster carer, Steven, collecting an achievement award from Andy Elvin, on behalf of a young person\" class=\"wp-image-18435\" style=\"width:800px\" srcset=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/11/TACT-foster-carer-Steven-accepting-an-award-1024x641.jpg 1024w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/11/TACT-foster-carer-Steven-accepting-an-award-300x188.jpg 300w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/11/TACT-foster-carer-Steven-accepting-an-award-768x480.jpg 768w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/11/TACT-foster-carer-Steven-accepting-an-award.jpg 1530w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This award is a wonderful reflection of the progress our young person has made, both academically and personally. Their journey demonstrates how consistency, encouragement and belief in one’s abilities can lead to remarkable growth and development. For many young people in care, school can sometimes be a challenging environment &#8211; but with the right support, understanding, and motivation, they can thrive and discover their full potential.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At TACT, we believe that<strong> </strong>recognising and celebrating success is a powerful part of building confidence and self-worth. Awards like this do more than highlight academic achievement &#8211; they remind our young people that effort, resilience, and perseverance truly matter. Every milestone reached is a step toward a brighter and more confident future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This achievement is thoroughly deserved, and we are incredibly proud of our young person and the progress they have made!</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/news/school-achievement-award/\">Young Person Honoured with School Achievement Award</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk\">TACT</a>.</p>",

In some cases, a young person may stay beyond their 18th birthday through a Staying Put Agreement. This allows them to continue education or training and better prepares them for independence.</p>\n<h4>Long-term foster care vs adoption: what’s the difference?</h4>\n<p>Long-term fostering is similar to adoption in that you provide a child with a home until they reach adulthood. However, when a child is adopted, parental responsibility is legally transferred to the adoptive parents. As a result, they have authority over decisions about their child and become financially responsible for them.</p>\n<p>When it comes to long-term fostering, birth parents and or the local authority hold parental responsibility. This means they have authority over certain decisions, such as taking a child on holiday and things like haircuts. As a long-term foster parent, you&#8217;ll also receive a <a href=\"https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/fostering-allowances/\">fostering allowance</a> to cover childcare expenses.</p>\n\n                                            </div>\n                                    <div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n                        <h3>How does long-term foster care and contact work?</h3>\n<p>If it&#8217;s in the best interests of a child or young person in long-term foster care to see family members, such as <a href=\"https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/about-fostering/types-of-fostering/fostering-siblings/\">siblings</a>, this will continue through family time arrangements.</p>\n<p>When you welcome a child home, you&#8217;ll receive details about family time arrangements, including frequency, location, who they&#8217;ll see and when they&#8217;ll take place.</p>\n<p>These arrangements are regularly reviewed to ensure that, as your foster child grows, they&#8217;re still in their best interests.</p>\n<h4>How does long-term foster care pay work?</h4>\n<p>Regardless of which type of foster care you choose to provide, at Fosterplus, you&#8217;ll receive a generous fostering allowance, which is typically tax-free.</p>\n<p>The amount you receive will differ depending on your location, the number of children in your care, the kind of fostering you offer, the children&#8217;s ages, and your experience.</p>\n<p>On average, our long-term foster parents receive between £20,187 and £25,749 per child, per year. Use our <a href=\"https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/fostering-allowances/fostering-allowance-calculator/\">fostering allowance calculator</a> to find out how much you could receive.</p>\n\n                                            </div>\n                            </div>\n            \n                        </div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div id=\"image-text-block_e57d57dcfbf9f30c772d5ceb0e796f35\" class=\"custom-block image-text-block alignfull image-right mobile-image-first has-light-grey-background-color theme-image-with-circle-top-centre spacing-top-full spacing-bottom-half width-full\" data-emergence=\"hidden\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"content\">\n            <h2>The lifelong impact of long-term fostering</h2>\n<p>Now we’ve answered some of the most pressing questions about long-term foster care, let’s jump into the life-changing impact it can have on you, your family, and the children in your care.</p>\n                    </div>\n\n                    <div class=\"media\">\n                <div class=\"img-wrapper\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"625\" height=\"329\" src=\"https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/long-term-foster-care-625x329.jpg\" class=\"attachment-half-width-desktop size-half-width-desktop\" alt=\"fostering long term\" srcset=\"https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/long-term-foster-care-625x329.jpg 625w, https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/long-term-foster-care-365x192.jpg 365w, https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/long-term-foster-care-875x461.jpg 875w, https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/long-term-foster-care-176x93.jpg 176w, https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/long-term-foster-care-768x405.jpg 768w, https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/long-term-foster-care-952x502.jpg 952w, https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/long-term-foster-care.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px\" /></div>\n            </div>\n            </div>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"content-block-block_ab9650d7dd4c0bc8fa76938397193d0d\" class=\"custom-block content-block alignfull has-light-grey-background-color theme-none spacing-top-none spacing-bottom-full width-full\" data-columns=\"1\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n\n                    <div class=\"content\">\n                <h3>Helping children feel settled</h3>\n<p>When children and young people move into care, they have to leave everything they’ve ever known behind. From their family and friends to their home and community, their whole life changes from one day to the next. And for some children, once in care, they may experience multiple moves, which means they never truly feel settled.</p>\n<p>By offering a child a long-term home, you provide a safe and stable space for them to plant roots and begin their journey of healing, growth, and discovery. They&#8217;ll have a familiar routine, a bedroom to call their own, and a family who they can rely on to support them until they&#8217;re ready to support themselves.</p>\n<h4>Building a true sense of belonging</h4>\n<p>Many children in care can struggle to find a sense of belonging. But when you provide a long-term foster home, it gives them a chance to find that with you.</p>\n<p>Living with you long-term means they&#8217;ll truly become part of your family. From holidays and special occasions to the monotony and stresses of daily life, you&#8217;ll give them the gift that so many of us take for granted – a home to call their own with a family who loves them.</p>\n<p>Most of all, you&#8217;ll teach them that safe, trusting relationships really do exist by being by their side through the ups and downs of life.</p>\n<p>Our award-winning foster parents, Christina and Roy, share their experience of fostering four siblings long-term:</p>\n<p><em>“Fostering really is a family effort. I couldn’t do it without my support network, which includes my grown-up kids. My daughter was only 14 when we first started fostering, and even now, she’ll correct anyone who doesn’t consider our 4 kids to be her ‘real’ siblings.”</em></p>\n<p><em>“Growing up in a foster home has not only given my daughter the amazing gift of more family, but it’s also given her the chance to learn lots about parenting and attachment, which will be a big help now that she’s got her own little one.&#8221;</em> Read their full fostering story <a class=\"Hyperlink SCXW16513095 BCX0\" href=\"https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/resources/news-blogs/case-studies/award-winning-foster-carers-christina-and-roy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><span class=\"TextRun Underlined SCXW16513095 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-GB\" xml:lang=\"EN-GB\" data-contrast=\"none\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW16513095 BCX0\" data-ccp-charstyle=\"Hyperlink\">here</span></span></a>.</p>\n<h4>Thriving at school</h4>\n<p>The experiences children and young people have been through when they enter care can have a knock-on effect on their academic achievement.</p>\n<p>Trauma weaves its way into every aspect of a child&#8217;s life. From finding it difficult to retain information and focus in the classroom to struggling with emotional regulation and trusting others, it can be harder for children in care to thrive at school.</p>\n<p>But when they have a long-term foster family advocating for their needs, ensuring they receive the right support, and helping them feel safe, stable and loved, they can begin to see school in a new light. Rather than being overwhelming and maybe even frightening, it could become a space to explore their interests, make friends, and build a beautiful future.</p>\n<p><em>“The best thing about fostering a child long term is seeing their growth both emotionally and educationally. &#8220;</em></p>\n<p><em>&#8220;We’ve gone from having a child who couldn’t function at school, wasn’t learning at all and couldn’t stay in class to a child who’s now a teenager and is doing really well in college. It makes you beam with pride. And knowing that, actually, without you, that might not have been his journey.”</em> Jodie Elliot, a long-term foster parent at Fosterplus, read her fostering story <a class=\"Hyperlink SCXW196758297 BCX0\" href=\"https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/resources/news-blogs/case-studies/jodies-story-of-long-term-fostering/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><span class=\"TextRun Underlined SCXW196758297 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-GB\" xml:lang=\"EN-GB\" data-contrast=\"none\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW196758297 BCX0\" data-ccp-charstyle=\"Hyperlink\">here</span></span></a>.</p>\n<h4>Preparing for life after care</h4>\n<p>When you foster a child long-term, at some point, they&#8217;ll become a teenager. Part of your role when <a href=\"https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/about-fostering/types-of-fostering/fostering-teenagers/\">fostering teenagers</a> is to prepare them for independent living. And because you&#8217;ve provided them with a long-term home where they feel safe, part of the family, and have had the chance to thrive at school, they&#8217;ll have a strong foundation.</p>\n<p>You can also go one step further by offering a Staying Put Agreement. These days, it&#8217;s quite rare for an 18-year-old to leave home. Even if they go to university, they can usually return to their family home during the holidays. This provides them with stability as they get to grips with adult responsibilities before becoming completely independent.</p>\n<p>Staying Put Agreements give young people in long-term foster homes the chance to do the same. This reduces the risk of them becoming homeless, unemployed, or going to prison when they <a class=\"Hyperlink SCXW153292836 BCX0\" href=\"https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/resources/news-blogs/blogs/leaving-foster-care/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><span class=\"TextRun Underlined SCXW153292836 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-GB\" xml:lang=\"EN-GB\" data-contrast=\"none\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW153292836 BCX0\" data-ccp-charstyle=\"Hyperlink\">leave care</span></span></a>, improving their overall outcomes.</p>\n<p><em>“My foster family are my family, and the ‘Staying Put’ arrangement has given me the best of both worlds. Foster parents do amazing work in giving children a stable family environment and a safe and loving home. The team at Fosterplus have been a great support to our family. Even though the social workers and staff are there for the foster parents, they’re also very much part of your life as a child and make sure that you’re supported, too.”</em> Erin, a Fosterplus care leaver, read her story <a class=\"Hyperlink SCXW72244293 BCX0\" href=\"https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/resources/news-blogs/case-studies/leaving-care-erins-journey-to-university-success/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><span class=\"TextRun Underlined SCXW72244293 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-GB\" xml:lang=\"EN-GB\" data-contrast=\"none\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW72244293 BCX0\" data-ccp-charstyle=\"Hyperlink\">here</span></span></a><span class=\"TextRun SCXW72244293 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-GB\" xml:lang=\"EN-GB\" data-contrast=\"auto\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW72244293 BCX0\">.</span></span>.</p>\n<h4>Healing from trauma</h4>\n<p>Providing children and young people with a long-term foster home won’t eradicate their trauma, but it can go a long way in helping them heal from their experiences.</p>\n<p>You and your family will be a constant in their lives, holding their hand as they navigate this strange, scary, and uncertain world.

When a foster child moves into your home, those dynamics will naturally change, and here’s why:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Routine adjustments: Your whole family will need to adjust to changes in your routine, which may include attending meetings, appointments, family time, training sessions, and more.</li>\n<li>Balancing attention: You&#8217;ll have to balance your time and attention between your own children and the children you foster.</li>\n<li>Changing roles: Your children&#8217;s place in the family may shift. For example, if you foster a younger child, your own children may take on new roles as older siblings and role models.</li>\n<li>Parenting approaches: You may need to approach parenting differently for your own children and the children you foster due to their trauma.</li>\n<li>New boundaries: You may need to introduce new boundaries, rules, and responsibilities which can take some getting used

You transfer the coffee from the jebena and into another pot a few times to keep the ground coffee mixing with the water and not accumulating at the top of the jebena.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Sieve the coffee</strong><br />\nOnce the coffee has brewed and really intensified, it’s time to get ready to serve it, you need to sieve this coffee so that it’s smooth and nice to drink</p>\n<p><strong>5. Serve</strong><br />\nPour the sieved coffee from the jebena into your traditional Eritrean coffee cups, with your preferred mixture of sugar and milk, or if you’re hardcore you can just drink it black.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Repeat </strong></p>\n<p>Traditionally, Eritrean coffee is served in three rounds, each one reducing in intensity but still an absolute flavour sensation!</p>\n                    </div>\n\n                    <div class=\"media\">\n                <div class=\"img-wrapper\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"625\" height=\"439\" src=\"https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Eritrean-Fostering-Coffee-morning-e1761068658172-625x439.jpg\" class=\"attachment-half-width-desktop size-half-width-desktop\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Eritrean-Fostering-Coffee-morning-e1761068658172-625x439.jpg 625w, https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Eritrean-Fostering-Coffee-morning-e1761068658172-365x256.jpg 365w, https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Eritrean-Fostering-Coffee-morning-e1761068658172-875x615.jpg 875w, https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Eritrean-Fostering-Coffee-morning-e1761068658172-176x124.jpg 176w, https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Eritrean-Fostering-Coffee-morning-e1761068658172-768x540.jpg 768w, https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Eritrean-Fostering-Coffee-morning-e1761068658172-1536x1079.jpg 1536w, https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Eritrean-Fostering-Coffee-morning-e1761068658172-952x669.jpg 952w, https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Eritrean-Fostering-Coffee-morning-e1761068658172.jpg 1580w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px\" /></div>\n            </div>\n            </div>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"content-block-block_ecd9ef422c34b9868a099c8a1888eb7b\" class=\"custom-block content-block alignfull has-none-background-color theme-multiple-misshapen-circles spacing-top-full spacing-bottom-full width-full\" data-columns=\"1\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n\n                    <div class=\"content\">\n                <h4 aria-level=\"2\"><strong>We are very grateful that Helen shares this wonderful part of her culture with us at Fosterplus.</strong></h4>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">If you&#8217;re new to fostering and want to learn more about the role of a foster parent, please get in touch.

They also provide a space for our foster carers to connect with other carers and our staff. Wellbeing and mental health for all is the overriding factor, and the memories and experiences generated at events such as these are priceless.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Feedback from the event was extremely positive:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Thank you for allowing my grandchildren to be part of this special day &#8211; they have had the best time” – <strong>TACT Foster Carer</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We had a brilliant time. Our young person said they had a brilliant time and really enjoyed herself, it was so lovely to see her with a smile on her face! &nbsp;– <strong>TACT Foster Carer</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We had a &nbsp;lovely time being face to face with everyone, we have really missed that” – <strong>TACT Foster Carer</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>“This was the best party I have ever been to!” – <strong>TACT Young Person</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I loved getting my face painted and being a leopard for the day” – <strong>TACT Young Person</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I loved the cupcakes!” &#8211; <strong>TACT Young Person</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>TACT were awarded the donation via the <strong><a href=\"https://www.johnlewis.com/our-services/helping-our-community\">John Lewis Community Matters Scheme</a></strong>, an initiative established to help local community groups and charities. Three organisations are selected every three months, and then customers decide how much each organisation receives by using tokens to vote.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are so grateful to John Lewis for the donation, and a big thank you to our North West team for providing our fostering households with an event they will remember for many years to come!</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"swiper-container\">\n\t<div class=\"swiper\">\n\t\t<div class=\"swiper-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"swiper-slide\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/10/A-TACT-foster-carer-wearing-flashing-glasses-at-a-wellbeing-event.jpg\" alt=\"A TACT foster carer wearing flashing glasses at a wellbeing event\" srcset=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/10/A-TACT-foster-carer-wearing-flashing-glasses-at-a-wellbeing-event-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/10/A-TACT-foster-carer-wearing-flashing-glasses-at-a-wellbeing-event-225x300.jpg 225w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/10/A-TACT-foster-carer-wearing-flashing-glasses-at-a-wellbeing-event-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/10/A-TACT-foster-carer-wearing-flashing-glasses-at-a-wellbeing-event.jpg 1512w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"swiper-slide\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/10/Stitch-surprising-one-of-our-carers-at-a-wellbeing-event.jpg\" alt=\"Stitch surprising one of our carers at a wellbeing event\" srcset=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/10/Stitch-surprising-one-of-our-carers-at-a-wellbeing-event-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/10/Stitch-surprising-one-of-our-carers-at-a-wellbeing-event-225x300.jpg 225w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/10/Stitch-surprising-one-of-our-carers-at-a-wellbeing-event-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/10/Stitch-surprising-one-of-our-carers-at-a-wellbeing-event.jpg 1512w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"swiper-slide\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/10/Two-TACT-foster-carers-posing-at-a-north-west-wellbeing-event.jpg\" alt=\"Two TACT foster carers posing at a north west wellbeing event\" srcset=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/10/Two-TACT-foster-carers-posing-at-a-north-west-wellbeing-event-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/10/Two-TACT-foster-carers-posing-at-a-north-west-wellbeing-event-225x300.jpg 225w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/10/Two-TACT-foster-carers-posing-at-a-north-west-wellbeing-event-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/10/Two-TACT-foster-carers-posing-at-a-north-west-wellbeing-event.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"swiper-slide\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/10/Two-TACT-staff-having-fun-at-a-wellbeing-event.jpg\" alt=\"Two TACT staff having fun at a wellbeing event\" srcset=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/10/Two-TACT-staff-having-fun-at-a-wellbeing-event-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/10/Two-TACT-staff-having-fun-at-a-wellbeing-event-225x300.jpg 225w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/10/Two-TACT-staff-having-fun-at-a-wellbeing-event-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/10/Two-TACT-staff-having-fun-at-a-wellbeing-event.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/news/john-lewis-donation-provides-wellbeing-event/\">John Lewis Donation Provides North West Wellbeing Event</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk\">TACT</a>.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Children of foster carers play an essential role in the fostering household, and they contribute so much to the lives of the foster children and young people placed in their home. The patience, understanding and support that children of foster carers give to foster children and young people does not go unnoticed, and we are thankful for their dedication to helping transform the lives of others less fortunate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We had the opportunity to speak with Holly about her experience, who, along with&nbsp;her older brother, grew up as a child of foster carers. Holly’s parents began fostering with Swiis in 2010, and shortly after their approval, they welcomed a foster sibling group of two females and two males into their home. With the foster children ranging in age from infancy to six years old, Holly, who was just nine at the time, quickly went from being the youngest in her family to having four younger foster children in the home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She recalls her dad introduced the idea of becoming a foster carer, and because her grandmother had been fostering for years, Holly already understood what it meant to welcome children in need into her home.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>“I remember being really excited about it and excited for my dad’s new career path.”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Holly shared with us some of her favourite earliest memories with the foster children.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em> “The female foster children and I all used to love it when I would do their makeup and paint their nails when we were younger. I take pride in knowing that they have always looked up to me and I’ve loved watching them grow up into beautiful, strong, and kind young women.”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the years, Holly has been amazed at&nbsp;watching each of the foster children in the home grow and thrive. She has seen the youngest foster boys adapt to the challenges of high school and overcome any social difficulties.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>“I’ve loved seeing the youngest boys grow up and mature, and love that the youngest often wants to spend time with me just to chat about his day and ask me about my life. The two female foster children are at that age now where we can talk like friends as well as sisters, and I love being able to talk and gossip about girl stuff and have fun with them outside of ‘older sibling duties’!”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>As Holly became no longer the youngest in her family, it meant that there was a shift in the role she played in the household, she stepped up, taking on more responsibilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>“I feel like I took on a lot of responsibilities from a younger age as I felt a bond early on and wanted to help care for them the best I could. The last few years I’ve occasionally helped my parents with babysitting when they want to go out for dinner or enjoy a holiday away, or even small moments when they want to go out for a walk. I’ve always tried to help where I can in looking after them.”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Individuals like Holly leave a lasting impact on the lives of foster children and young people. She has played a significant role in creating a safe, stable, and loving environment by being a trusted and caring role model for them. Her dedication is a reminder of how the entire family plays a crucial part in the fostering experience, making a meaningful difference in the lives of those they welcome into their home.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Thinking about fostering?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re considering fostering and want to learn more about how Swiis can support both you and your children throughout the journey, <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/contact/\">contact our recruitment team</a> who can answer any questions you might have.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/children-of-foster-carers-hollys-story/\">Children of Foster Carers – Holly’s Story</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com\">Swiis Foster Care</a>.</p>",

At TACT, we’re passionate about helping young people to thrive, both on and off the field. Sponsoring Orrell St James ARLFC wasn’t just about providing new kit; it was about showing our commitment to young people’s aspirations and celebrating the positive impact that teamwork, confidence, and belonging can have on their lives. We’re proud to play a small part in encouraging them to chase their goals and stay active in a supportive environment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We then went to watch them play on Sunday 12<sup>th</sup> October!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was lovely to hear such positive feedback from both the team coach and our foster carers:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Thank you for helping our team out, we really appreciate it”– <strong>Orrell St James ARLFC &nbsp;Team Coach</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Thank you &#8211; the team look very smart and turn up looking the part thanks to our sponsor TACT” –<strong> Parent/carer</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Thanks for making &nbsp;sure the boys are not only warm and dry over the winter season, but look smart it is really appreciated” – <strong>Parent/carer</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Thank you very much for not only sponsoring the team but taking the time to come and support them &#8211; we really do appreciate TACT” – <strong>Parent/Carer</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We wish Orrell St James ARLFC the very best of luck!</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-9d6595d7 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/10/TACT-Rugby-Top-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"A Orrell St James ARLFC rugby top, that TACT provided the team with\" class=\"wp-image-18235\" srcset=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/10/TACT-Rugby-Top-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/10/TACT-Rugby-Top-225x300.jpg 225w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/10/TACT-Rugby-Top-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/10/TACT-Rugby-Top-1536x2048.jpg 1536w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/10/TACT-Rugby-Top-scaled.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/10/TACT-staff-watch-the-rugby-match-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Three TACT staff watching Orrell St James ARLFC rugby team play\" class=\"wp-image-18236\" srcset=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/10/TACT-staff-watch-the-rugby-match-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/10/TACT-staff-watch-the-rugby-match-225x300.jpg 225w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/10/TACT-staff-watch-the-rugby-match-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/10/TACT-staff-watch-the-rugby-match-1536x2048.jpg 1536w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/10/TACT-staff-watch-the-rugby-match-scaled.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/news/tact-sponsors-childrens-rugby/\">TACT’s Sponsorship Tackles Children’s Rugby Top Shortage</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk\">TACT</a>.</p>",

Though school and college can often put pressure on you to pick a career path early on, it’s perfectly normal to not have a ‘dream job’ while you’re still in your teens. Think of your career plan as a direction to head towards, not a final destination; you don’t have to stick to it rigidly, but having a goal to work towards can be great!</p>\n<p>No job is perfect— if they were, companies wouldn’t have to pay us to do them! That being said, no one wants a job that they don’t enjoy, and it’s important that the job you choose aligns with your personal priorities. This could mean that your job is enjoyable, helps support a cause you care about or gives you something you value, like more money, time or flexibility.</p>\n                    </div>\n\n                    <div class=\"media\">\n                <div class=\"img-wrapper\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"625\" height=\"417\" src=\"https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/career-plan-625x417.jpg\" class=\"attachment-half-width-desktop size-half-width-desktop\" alt=\"a career plan\" srcset=\"https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/career-plan-625x417.jpg 625w, https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/career-plan-365x243.jpg 365w, https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/career-plan-875x584.jpg 875w, https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/career-plan-176x117.jpg 176w, https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/career-plan-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/career-plan-952x635.jpg 952w, https://www.fosterplus.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/career-plan.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px\" /></div>\n            </div>\n            </div>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"content-block-block_ccc786eff223ee19bbdadad300b0c833\" class=\"custom-block content-block alignfull has-light-grey-background-color theme-none spacing-top-full spacing-bottom-full width-narrow\" data-columns=\"1\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n\n                    <div class=\"content\">\n                <h2>How to build your career plan</h2>\n<p>Building a career plan is simple and can really kick-start your plans for the future.

This is a great starting point for building a career plan, but if you’re unsure of what job you want in the future, that’s perfectly normal.</p>\n<p>We’ve put together a quick and easy template which you can use to help you find the right path for you if you don’t have a dream job in mind yet.

You may find that your foster parents or other adults in your life try to turn you away from certain jobs, such as becoming a streamer, influencer or e-sports competitor. While people can really make it big in these industries, it may not be wise to put all of your eggs in one basket, as it’s very difficult to make it big in these job roles.</p>\n<p>Being realistic does not, however, mean giving up on your dreams— most people who made it big in these industries started off by doing it as a fun hobby, not for financial reward. These roles can be great passion projects to work towards alongside a regular job, with the hope of one day making them your full-time career!</li>\n<li>\n<h3>Research your next steps to success.</h3>\n<p>Now that you know where you’d like your career to take you, it’s time to research the steps you’ll need to take to get there. You could use google, head to your local library or discuss your options with a work coach or trusted adult.</p>\n<p>Write down every step you’ll need to get the job of your dreams— for example, to become an Engineer, you’ll need to focus on math and science at school, choose a branch of engineering which interests you most such as aerospace or computers, and then study this branch at university.

      "content": "<p>Children of Foster Carers’ Week is an annual campaign organised by <a href=\"https://www.thefosteringnetwork.org.uk/about-fostering/for-fostering-services/recruitment-and-retention/children-of-foster-carers-month/\">The Fostering Network</a>, taking place from 13th to 19th October 2025. The week was created to recognise and celebrate the incredible role that the children of foster carers play within a fostering household.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether a foster carer’s child is young, a teenager, or has grown up and moved out of the family home, the children of foster carers often provide support to both their parents and the foster child or young person. Some responsibilities they have can include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Being a positive role model for the child or young person</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Supporting with everyday tasks, such as school pick-ups or cooking</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sharing personal things like toys, books, or games</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Helping them learn about responsibilities within the home</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Offering a listening ear and someone they can talk to</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout the week, we will be sharing case studies from children of foster carers to highlight their experiences and the vital role they play in the fostering household. These stories highlight how fostering has impacted their life and the amazing memories they have had watching foster children and young people develop over their time together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To kick start Children of Foster Carers week, we spoke to Lockie and Pippa, who shared what their favourite memory with a foster child or young person has been so far, what they enjoy most about being part of a fostering household, how their responsibilities may have changed over time, and any additional thoughts they wanted to share.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Lockie – Aged 9</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What has been your most memorable or special experience with a foster child?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“When we all went to Disneyland at Christmas. It was good having L to go on all the rides with, especially the bigger ones, because my sisters don’t like them. We like the Spider-Man ride the most, shooting webs with our hands and wearing the 3D glasses.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What do you enjoy most about having a foster child in your home?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“L plays football with me in the garden and plays Roblox with me on the Xbox. He’s getting better at playing with me, and it’s good having a boy to play outside with at football.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Have your responsibilities at home changed since your family began fostering? If so, how?</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“I help him and remind him how to be good, especially because my little sister copies, and we need to teach her to be kind.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Pippa – Aged 15</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What has been your most memorable or special experience with a foster child?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I have had lots of lovely memories of past and present little ones, building special bonds that last a lifetime, Christmases full of excitement and magic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Times when I come home from school to be greeted with 2 little ones chanting my name as I walk through the door, both wanting big hugs.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What do you enjoy most about having a foster child in your home?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“Fun and laughter everywhere, to stay with me forever.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Have your responsibilities at home changed since your family began fostering? If so, how?</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“They have stayed the same even though things have changed. I enjoy playing with toys and reading stories.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Is there anything else you would like to share about your experiences?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“I have found it to be really positive having my parents be able to foster, even though it does have its sad times, like when they move on to adoption.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>To view more case studies from Children of Foster Carers, take a look at our <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/info-hub/\">Info Hub</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Thinking about becoming a foster carer?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are interested in learning more about becoming a foster carer,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/contact/\">get in touch with our recruitment team,</a>&nbsp;who can answer any questions you have about fostering and provide you with information on the excellent&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/fostering/support/\">support</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/fostering/training/\">training</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/fostering/fostering-allowance-pay/\">allowance</a>&nbsp;Swiis offers.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/children-of-foster-carers-week/\">Children of Foster Carers’ Week</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com\">Swiis Foster Care</a>.</p>",

For some families, this means their child has spent most of their life as an only child, until the family decides to welcome foster children into their home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was the case for Summer, who grew up as an only child for 13 years before her parents began fostering two girls, aged 1 and 12 at the time. While the transition from being an only child to suddenly having other children in the household can be a big adjustment, Summer embraced the change and quickly thrived in her new role as the oldest child in the family.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like any change in routine, fostering comes with challenges that the whole family must navigate. But for Summer, the rewards far outweigh the difficulties.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>“I have a few things that I enjoy about us being a foster family. I love that there is always someone to spend time with and chat with. I also really like that when we became a foster family, Dad started spending more time at home because he left his old job, and now I get to see both Mum and Dad all the time, which is really nice.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“I like that we are a bigger family now. When our house and my Auntie’s house get together, there are over ten of us. We used to just be three, but now we are five, and I really like that.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“I also like that we all share things and help each other. For example, J played with my rabbit, Princess, last week, and while she was with her, she cleaned her out, which I was really happy about because that’s usually my job. In return, I helped J organise her wardrobe. We just do everything together.”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the past couple of years, Summer’s relationship with the foster children has blossomed, and together they have already created so many memorable experiences.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>“My favourite thing we have experienced together is our holiday. We have had so many amazing times, but without a doubt, going to the Caribbean as a family was my favourite. The things I took for granted on holiday, they were just so excited about, and I really enjoyed sharing those moments with them. Plus, every time we wanted to play in the pool, there was always someone to play with.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“Things like the plane ride stood out to me. I moaned about being on the plane for 9 hours, but they were so excited and grateful for just getting the opportunity to go on the plane.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“We also went zip-lining through the Caribbean Lake Park, which was really special. That is one of my favourite memories ever.”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>As Summer’s relationships with the children have grown, her role within the household has changed, and she has taken on more responsibilities as the oldest child.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>“It’s great how my responsibilities have changed! I used to have the jobs of dishwasher and recycling, but now J does the dishwasher, and I do the recycling, so we have split the jobs, which is good because I didn’t like the dishwasher, but J doesn’t mind it.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“I am the oldest now, so I do older sister stuff, like reminding P to put her coat on and trying to teach her how to fasten her shoelaces. I also taught J how to straighten and curl her hair.”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>As Summer has taken on new responsibilities at home, she has also had time to reflect on how fostering has shaped her life and how it might influence her future. When asked if there was anything else she would like to share about her experiences, Summer said:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>“Fostering has been in my life since I was really young. I was 6 or 7 when Auntie started, and then 12 when Mum and Dad started, so I am pretty used to the fostering world now. Since we started fostering, we have had really good days, but also some really difficult days. Everyone tells us ‘It’s a journey’, but that’s because it actually is.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“I’m really happy with where we are now though, life’s normal for us. I feel really proud that we foster, and I have even started thinking about becoming a foster carer myself when I’m older. I’m going to finish Uni and get my degree, but I really do think I will take a similar path and foster. I want to foster teens. Seeing how J opened up to me when we chatted, I think I’d be good with teens.”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Summer’s inspiring story of growing up as the child of foster carers highlights the incredible experiences and memories that fostering has given her, as well as how it has influenced her future. Fostering can be a life-changing experience for everyone involved, not just the children and young people in care, but for the entire family.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Thinking about becoming a foster carer?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are interested in learning more about becoming a foster carer,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/contact/\">get in touch with our recruitment team,</a>&nbsp;who can answer any questions you have about fostering and provide you with information on the excellent&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/fostering/support/\">support</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/fostering/training/\">training</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/fostering/fostering-allowance-pay/\">allowance</a>&nbsp;Swiis offers.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/children-of-foster-carers-summers-story/\">Children of Foster Carers &#8211; Summer’s Story </a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com\">Swiis Foster Care</a>.</p>",

Between attending meetings and appointments, school runs, managing household tasks, and finding time for yourself, you can quickly begin to feel stretched without careful planning.</p>\n<p>There may also be times when you feel like everything is under control, until something unexpected happens, such as a family member falling ill, and suddenly everything feels too much.</p>\n<h3 aria-level=\"3\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Overwhelm and mental health </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134245418&quot;:true,&quot;134245529&quot;:true,&quot;335559738&quot;:160,&quot;335559739&quot;:80}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Overwhelm can have a profound impact on your </span><a href=\"https://www.orangegrovefostercare.co.uk/about-fostering/who-can-foster/mental-health-fostering/\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">mental health</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\">, triggering conditions like anxiety and depression and leading to fatigue, irritability, or feeling trapped.

It doesn’t need to be in any particular order or even make any sense, but brain dumping everything onto a piece of paper can help lift the weight from your mind.</p>\n<p>Once it’s written down, you can start prioritising, organising and regaining a sense of control. For example, you could split tasks into categories like &#8216;To Do Now,&#8217; &#8216;To Do Tomorrow,&#8217; and &#8216;Can Wait Until Later&#8217; so you can tackle things one step at a time, rather than trying to think about everything all at once.</li>\n<li>\n<h3>Take a step back</h3>\n<p>When everything feels too much, feelings of failure can begin to creep in, especially if you’re overwhelmed by a situation you’re facing with the child in your care. In moments like these, it’s vital to take a step back and look at the bigger picture.</p>\n<p>Yes, you might be finding a particular behaviour or scenario tricky, but when you take time to reflect, you’ll see how far you and the child in your care have actually come.</p>\n<p>It’s also important to remind yourself that you&#8217;re not alone; everyone feels overwhelmed sometimes. It isn’t a sign of failure – if anything, it’s a sign that you&#8217;re giving so much of yourself that you&#8217;ve forgotten you matter too</li>\n<li>\n<h3>Don’t ignore your mental health</h3>\n<p>When things feel hard, <a class=\"Hyperlink SCXW31610159 BCX0\" href=\"https://www.orangegrovefostercare.co.uk/resources/blogs/looking-after-your-mental-health/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><span class=\"TextRun Underlined SCXW31610159 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-GB\" xml:lang=\"EN-GB\" data-contrast=\"none\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW31610159 BCX0\" data-ccp-charstyle=\"Hyperlink\">caring for your mental health</span></span></a> becomes even more important. Whether it’s taking a walk in the park, watching rubbish TV, or eating your favourite food, do whatever helps bring you a bit of peace, even if just for half an hour.</p>\n<p>During difficult times, it’s also crucial to be mindful about what you’re viewing online. If you enjoy scrolling through social media or checking up on the news, when you’re already feeling overwhelmed, absorbing the chaos of the world can actually make things worse. Instead, opt for some light-hearted reels or find other activities that soothe your mind. We have a few ideas in our <a class=\"Hyperlink SCXW244854111 BCX0\" href=\"https://www.orangegrovefostercare.co.uk/resources/blogs/self-care-guide-for-foster-parents/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><span class=\"TextRun Underlined SCXW244854111 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-GB\" xml:lang=\"EN-GB\" data-contrast=\"none\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW244854111 BCX0\" data-ccp-charstyle=\"Hyperlink\">ultimate self-care guide</span></span></a>.</li>\n<li>\n<h3>Set realistic expectations</h3>\n<p>Goals are good, they drive us forward, keep us focused, and give us purpose – but only if they’re realistic. Unrealistic goals can leave you feeling overwhelmed and defeated, especially if they feel impossible to reach.</p>\n<p>Remember, the main goal of a foster parent is to provide a safe, stable and nurturing home that helps children and young people achieve the best possible outcomes. But when you foster a child living with trauma, healing and progress take time.</p>\n<p>Set small goals and celebrate when you reach them. For example, they could be as simple as encouraging the child in your care to brush their teeth, do their homework on time, or eat a banana. These little achievements are likely more significant than you realise, and can remind you that you are having a positive impact when you&#8217;re feeling overwhelmed.</li>\n<li>\n<h3>You’re not a robot</h3>\n<p>Sometimes you have to remind yourself that you&#8217;re only human, you’re not a robot, and your capacity for mental stress is not unlimited. There may be times on your fostering journey where you need to take a break, and that’s exactly why we offer <a class=\"Hyperlink SCXW16686699 BCX0\" href=\"https://www.orangegrovefostercare.co.uk/about-fostering/types-of-fostering/respite-fostering/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><span class=\"TextRun Underlined SCXW16686699 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-GB\" xml:lang=\"EN-GB\" data-contrast=\"none\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW16686699 BCX0\" data-ccp-charstyle=\"Hyperlink\">respite foster care</span></span></a>.</p>\n<p>Caring for a child living with trauma can be challenging, and asking to take a break is a lot better than throwing in the towel because you’re feeling overwhelmed. Sometimes all you need is a little time to yourself to be with your own thoughts and do your own thing, so you feel rested and ready to take on the next challenge.</p>\n<p>Respite isn’t selfish; taking care of yourself ensures you’re in the right frame of mind to continue providing the best possible care.</li>\n</ol>\n\n                            </div>\n        \n            </div>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"content-block-block_d82dfc0c9355f0f3d6dacb1a6dbb6581\" class=\"custom-block content-block alignfull has-none-background-color theme-none spacing-top-full spacing-bottom-full width-full\" data-columns=\"1\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n\n                    <div class=\"content\">\n                <h3 aria-level=\"2\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Remember: You’re never alone</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134245418&quot;:true,&quot;134245529&quot;:true,&quot;335559738&quot;:160,&quot;335559739&quot;:80}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">When you foster with Orange Grove, you’re never alone on your fostering journey.

Adultification is a type of racial bias which assumes that a child is somehow less innocent, more mature or more responsible than they really are, leading to children being treated as though they were adults. This can be harmful in many ways, including the risk that Police and law enforcement will stereotype children</span> <span data-contrast=\"auto\">with black heritage, or assign adult motives to them. Another element of adultification particularly impacts black girls, that being the sexualisation of black girls which can lead to authorities putting blame on them as victims for the abuse they suffer at the hands of predatory adults. </span></p>\n\n                                            </div>\n                                    <div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n                        <p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Social worker and lecturer Nana Yabbey-Hagan gave some great insight into where adultification rears its head among professionals on an episode of The Social Worker &amp; The Mentor Podcast. He said:</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><i><span data-contrast=\"auto\">‘I&#8217;m a black male social worker and I’ve heard the language and the rhetoric of professionals, how they&#8217;re describing [black children], and I&#8217;ve had to step in and say to them, I&#8217;m quite offended by how you&#8217;re describing this child or young person. There&#8217;s a duty of care that you have regardless of [race], and what you&#8217;re doing is not taking into account the vulnerabilities of this child.’</span></i><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><i><span data-contrast=\"auto\">‘The question has to be if that child in front of you was not a black child, would you be using the same language? That&#8217;s the reason why in our community you find that a lot of black families [engaging with child services] don&#8217;t trust the professionals because they feel that there&#8217;s a level of inequality and discrimination that&#8217;s at work, and that professionals have a certain view of children who are black and won&#8217;t give them the level of care they should have in comparison to their white counterparts.’</span></i><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">As Nana says, adultification can be both subtle or advert, and is something which professionals working with children must learn to address and combat.

      "snippet": "When a family begins their fostering journey, it does not just impact the foster carers themselves, it affects everyone connected to the household, including their children. The post Children of Foster Carers – Harmeet’s Story appeared first on Swiis Foster Care.",
      "content": "<p>When a family begins their fostering journey, it does not just impact the foster carers themselves, it affects everyone connected to the household, including their children. For many children of foster carers, it means learning to share their home, toys and even their parents&#8217; time, but for those older children who are now adults no longer living at home, fostering impacts them differently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This has been the case for Harmeet, as when her parents decided to foster, she was no longer living in the family household, but she still experienced the rewards of fostering and found ways to support her parents and the children in their care.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>“Seeing a foster child feeling safe and happy at home is rewarding because we are able to work together and provide a stable and caring environment. Even though I don’t live at home, I support my parents by helping care for the children when they are away for the day. It’s meaningful to be part of that support system and contribute in any way I can.”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Fostering brings many new responsibilities, and it is not only the foster carers themselves who have a change in responsibility, but also everyone close to them who plays a part in supporting the journey. For Harmeet, she has played a massive part in supporting her parents with the children and young people they foster, and it has taught her valuable emotional and interpersonal skills.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>“My responsibilities have changed since my parents began fostering. Even though I no longer live at home, I now help more with caring for the foster children when I visit or when my parents are out for the day.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“I might play with them, help with meals, or just keep them company so they feel safe and supported. It has taught me the importance of consistency and patience, and I feel proud to be part of something that really makes a difference.”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the years that Harmeet’s parents have fostered, she has built many wonderful memories with the children and young people who have joined their family. Each new arrival has brought new experiences, and Harmeet continues to form special bonds with all the children her parents look after, making a lasting impact on her.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>“One of the most memorable experiences I had was with a foster child who came into our home at the age of 3. From the beginning, we built a strong and positive bond. I enjoyed getting her small toys and gifts, which always brought her joy. Although I no longer see her in person as often, we stay connected through regular video calls. She lights up with excitement every time we talk, and seeing that joy reminds me how meaningful even the smallest connections can be in a child’s life.”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Harmeet’s story highlights that even when a child of foster carers is an adult and no longer living in the family home, they can still be deeply impacted by the rewarding experiences that fostering brings. It has given Harmeet a new perspective on responsibility and shown her just how meaningful fostering can be in a child or young person’s life.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Thinking about becoming a foster carer?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are interested in learning more about becoming a foster carer,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/contact/\">get in touch with our recruitment team,</a>&nbsp;who can answer any questions you have about fostering and provide you with information on the excellent&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/fostering/support/\">support</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/fostering/training/\">training</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/fostering/fostering-allowance-pay/\">allowance</a>&nbsp;Swiis offers.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/children-of-foster-carers-harmeets-story/\">Children of Foster Carers &#8211; Harmeet&#8217;s Story</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com\">Swiis Foster Care</a>.</p>",

For Rachel, this allowed her to witness firsthand the impact that care, support, and guidance can have on a child’s life. Rachel&#8217;s mother&#8217;s decision to foster not only shaped the dynamics of their family but also inspired Rachel’s own path in life, leading her to become a foster carer herself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rachel has always believed that the rewards of welcoming foster children into her household far outweigh any challenges. For her, the addition of foster children and young people felt natural, and a lot of her daily life remained the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>“Having foster children was great, it was like inviting our ‘bonus family’ into our home. We extended our family to those who need it most and seeing them grow and progress into young adults is one of the most rewarding things I have experienced.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“I also don’t feel anything changed when we gained our bonus family. We made sure they felt safe and secure, but we lived our lives as normal with our new additions.”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>During the years of being a child of a foster carer, Rachel was part of countless special memories that ranged from small, everyday moments to life-changing events. From playful afternoons in the garden to the celebrations of important milestones, these experiences left a lasting impression on her.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>“Over the time that my mother was a foster carer, we had many memorable experiences, so it&#8217;s hard to choose one! I remember setting up a water slide in our garden on a summer&#8217;s day, which ended up in a big water fight with lots of laughs! We have shared memories on holidays, life celebrations, and milestones. One of the biggest highlights was when we had the honour of reuniting a child with her mother after around 10 years of separation. It brought tears to everyone’s eyes. What an amazing moment to be a part of!”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The impact of fostering as a child of a foster carer stayed with Rachel, and today she has followed in her mother’s footsteps, becoming a foster carer herself, which Rachel would encourage all to try if they can.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>“I would like to add that if anyone is considering fostering but unsure due to their birth children, in my experience, it added a level of gratitude, empathy, and love that I wouldn’t have experienced if my mother didn’t foster. Seeing those children grow to the amazing individuals they are today encouraged me to become a foster carer myself. I have now been doing this for almost three years, and I’ve enjoyed it from day one.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“Give it a go and change some lives!”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>To read more about Rachel and her mother, Vicky’s fostering journey, you can read their story <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/story/vicky-and-rachels-fostering-story/\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Thinking about becoming a foster carer?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are interested in learning more about becoming a foster carer,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/contact/\">get in touch with our recruitment team,</a>&nbsp;who can answer any questions you have about fostering and provide you with information on the excellent&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/fostering/support/\">support</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/fostering/training/\">training</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/fostering/fostering-allowance-pay/\">allowance</a>&nbsp;Swiis offers.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/children-of-foster-carers-rachels-story/\">Children of Foster Carers – Rachel’s Story</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com\">Swiis Foster Care</a>.</p>",

She decided to look into it. She&#8217;s now been a TACT foster carer for 17 years.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many years ago I was helping out in the local school, and one of the teachers was a TACT foster carer and she kept saying to me ‘you could do this &#8211; the way you are with children’. So it was actually one of the school teachers that got me into this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I gave TACT a call, hoping that they were going to take me seriously &#8211; and I&#8217;m still here 17 years later.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-tact-brand-gray-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-530a69ab49bf5c75173cc4b0d8d9acc3\" id=\"h-you-can-foster-as-a-family\">You can foster as a family</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When I did look into [fostering] further, we only had my son Ben at home at the time – the other three had left. Ben was 9 when I first started to look into it, and by the time TACT had come out and done all their investigations, and I&#8217;d done the Skills to Foster course &#8211; we actually became foster carers when our own son was 10.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ben&#8217;s always grown up around other foster children because his best friends in school were twins and they were both fostered. So he understood the fostering side of looking after children. He actually just thrived with the six year old little boy. They both had the same interests &#8211; it just worked really well.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think Ben ever had his face put out of joint because this isn&#8217;t <em>my</em> adventure, this is our family adventure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>TACT always do a yearly annual summer trip and things like that, then they do the Christmas parties and discos. One year we actually did Disneyland, Paris &#8211; so my own son actually came along and joined in on that as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-tact-brand-light-blue-background-color has-background is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-8cf370e7 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-8cf370e7 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta \">\n\t<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta__inner\">\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta__left\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta__image\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"image-bubble\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/Foster-carer-Trina-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"This it Trina, a TACT foster carer in her back garden\" srcset=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/Foster-carer-Trina-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/Foster-carer-Trina-300x200.jpg 300w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/Foster-carer-Trina-768x512.jpg 768w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/Foster-carer-Trina-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/Foster-carer-Trina-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/Foster-carer-Trina-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"quote-bubble\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<svg width=\"164\" height=\"144\" viewBox=\"0 0 164 144\" fill=\"none\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<path d=\"M33.4844 9.58621C61.8844 -8.81379 93.5 3.92638 109.484 9.58621C184.5 38.9263 175.484 121.086 118.984 138.586C62.4844 156.086 26.9844 122.086 9.48441 88.0863C-8.01559 54.0863 -2.01559 32.5862 33.4844 9.58621Z\" fill=\"white\"/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<path d=\"M90.7797 94.5568C80.2697 82.8104 87.4825 62.2025 96.3438 54.3716C103.763 47.571 116.127 42.0069 117.364 44.0677C119.218 47.1588 112.006 49.2196 106.442 54.1655C99.6411 61.5843 97.3742 64.8816 106.854 69.0031C116.952 73.5369 117.158 78.0706 117.57 83.8408C118.188 98.0602 101.084 104.655 90.7797 94.5568Z\" fill=\"#E11F8F\"/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<path d=\"M51.2119 94.3504C40.7019 82.604 47.9146 61.9961 56.776 54.1652C64.1948 47.3646 76.5595 41.8005 77.796 43.8613C79.6507 46.9524 72.438 49.0133 66.8738 53.9592C60.0733 61.378 57.8064 64.6752 67.286 68.7967C77.3838 73.3305 77.5899 77.8642 78.0021 83.6344C78.6203 97.8538 61.5158 104.448 51.2119 94.3504Z\" fill=\"#E11F8F\"/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</svg>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta__right\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"acf-innerblocks-container\">\n\n<p style=\"font-size:24px\">&#8220;I just love what I do and seeing that little difference &#8211; you don&#8217;t have to see a huge difference you know, just tiny little steps.

It&#8217;s about being positive, not looking at everything that&#8217;s negative and helping them to develop confidence in their own abilities, so they can move on and realise that they can do things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The support from TACT has been superb. I have the finest Supervising Social Worker that any person could ever have. She is absolutely brilliant.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-tact-brand-gray-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-8fac86eba2729a991ac1d155f057d83c\" id=\"h-encouraging-a-hobby\">Encouraging a hobby</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My young lady [who I was providing care for] did some artwork. She was very keen on arts and crafts. I have a friend who does lots of art and crafts, and she runs classes. So I went along [with my young person]. I wasn’t very good at it, but she was brilliant. I went so that she would gain confidence. People could see how good she was. I learned a lot about colours and that, while I was there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I encourage all my young people to do things. A young person wanted to learn to swim, so I made sure she learned to swim. I try to find out what their hobbies are and then encourage them to do it. It just means sometimes having to take them places and then picking them up.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-tact-brand-light-blue-background-color has-background is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-8cf370e7 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-8cf370e7 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta \">\n\t<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta__inner\">\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta__left\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta__image\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"image-bubble\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/Aileen-TACT-foster-carer2-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"This is Aileen, TACT foster carer since 2014, standing in her kitchen\" srcset=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/Aileen-TACT-foster-carer2-1024x737.jpg 1024w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/Aileen-TACT-foster-carer2-300x216.jpg 300w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/Aileen-TACT-foster-carer2-768x553.jpg 768w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/Aileen-TACT-foster-carer2-1536x1106.jpg 1536w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/Aileen-TACT-foster-carer2-2048x1475.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"quote-bubble\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<svg width=\"164\" height=\"144\" viewBox=\"0 0 164 144\" fill=\"none\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<path d=\"M33.4844 9.58621C61.8844 -8.81379 93.5 3.92638 109.484 9.58621C184.5 38.9263 175.484 121.086 118.984 138.586C62.4844 156.086 26.9844 122.086 9.48441 88.0863C-8.01559 54.0863 -2.01559 32.5862 33.4844 9.58621Z\" fill=\"white\"/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<path d=\"M90.7797 94.5568C80.2697 82.8104 87.4825 62.2025 96.3438 54.3716C103.763 47.571 116.127 42.0069 117.364 44.0677C119.218 47.1588 112.006 49.2196 106.442 54.1655C99.6411 61.5843 97.3742 64.8816 106.854 69.0031C116.952 73.5369 117.158 78.0706 117.57 83.8408C118.188 98.0602 101.084 104.655 90.7797 94.5568Z\" fill=\"#E11F8F\"/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<path d=\"M51.2119 94.3504C40.7019 82.604 47.9146 61.9961 56.776 54.1652C64.1948 47.3646 76.5595 41.8005 77.796 43.8613C79.6507 46.9524 72.438 49.0133 66.8738 53.9592C60.0733 61.378 57.8064 64.6752 67.286 68.7967C77.3838 73.3305 77.5899 77.8642 78.0021 83.6344C78.6203 97.8538 61.5158 104.448 51.2119 94.3504Z\" fill=\"#E11F8F\"/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</svg>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta__right\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"acf-innerblocks-container\">\n\n<p style=\"font-size:24px\">“I encourage all my young people to do things.

They will miss the bus back so the most important thing is that they know that they can phone you. I always have a place of safety, usually it’s Sainsbury&#8217;s supermarket or somewhere where they can wait for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The advice I would give is that you&#8217;ve got to accept the ups and downs. There is going to be trials and tribulations. They trust you, they&#8217;ve got faith in you and they&#8217;re looking to you to help them. Be to be patient and help them to feel secure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve always had lots of ambition for my young people. I try very hard to instil ambition into them, but I have learned that some young people are just happy doing something different &#8211; they don&#8217;t all want to go to university. So I have learnt to look a little bit more at the needs of a young person, rather than my ambition for them. It’s about supporting them in whatever it is they want to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A highlight of mine has been a young lady who actually was determined she wasn&#8217;t going to be staying in the care system &#8211; but actually stayed for four years and then said ‘I would have made the biggest mistake of my life if I had left’. I watched her grow from a frightened little girl who had been thrown out of a family home with nothing and nobody, into a Deputy Manager at a store. When I see her in the store I sometimes look at that young lady, and I remember a 12 year old girl who was terrified.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-9d6595d7 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:60%\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"&quot;I watched her grow from a frightened little girl into a deputy manager&quot;\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RuPsuvFwaUs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-buttons is-content-justification-center is-layout-flex wp-container-core-buttons-is-layout-16018d1d wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link wp-element-button\" href=\"https://youtu.be/2zzYSaSNarM\">Watch Aileen&#8217;s full video</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\"></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-tact-brand-light-gray-background-color has-background is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-8cf370e7 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-tact-brand-light-gray-background-color has-background is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-8cf370e7 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-tact-brand-light-gray-background-color has-background\" id=\"start-journey\" style=\"font-size:50px\">Start Your Fostering Journey.

This category honours foster carers who demonstrate perseverance, advocacy, and an unwavering commitment to placing the needs of children at the centre of their care.</p>\n<p>Over the last 14 years, Amanda and David have provided a safe and nurturing home for many children, consistently going above and beyond to ensure every child feels valued and supported. Their dedication extends beyond fostering placements, with the couple maintaining relationships with families long after children have moved on, reflecting the depth of care they bring to their role.</p>\n\n                            </div>\n        \n            </div>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"content-block-block_04262e5874d3c7711e2ed0d2b20ac5c3\" class=\"custom-block content-block alignfull has-dark-green-background-color has-dark-background theme-curve-top-right-bottom-left-white spacing-top-full spacing-bottom-full width-full\" data-columns=\"1\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n\n                    <div class=\"content\">\n                <p>A shining example of their approach is seen in the long-term placement of a young boy with Down’s Syndrome.

From organising family visits and sharing holiday photos, to supporting milestone events and everyday celebrations, the Eyeingtons ensure he enjoys a strong sense of belonging in both his foster and birth family.</p>\n<p>Their commitment to advocacy is also evident in education. When the young boy faced barriers at school, Amanda championed his right to use adaptive technology so he could take part fully alongside his peers.

After all, it’s a role or a life choice that means that you open your home to young people who may have never experienced a nurturing and supportive home life. You provide care, guidance, help with school or finding a job. You’re a shoulder and a crutch when needed and are always there for them. You say the right things at the right times, are never wrong and can teleport anywhere in the country at will.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, that really would be superhuman.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in the real world, it’s hardly surprising that fostering can appear intimidating or out of reach for many people. They believe that they don’t possess the right level of skills or experience, or they think that they have to achieve life-changing outcomes for young people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What many people don’t see are the foster carers who come from different vocational backgrounds, who are just regular, ordinary people who want to help and make a difference. The people who understand a young person’s needs and are able to make the smallest changes that have the potential to be game changing for a young person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is how ordinary people make extraordinary differences, and as a charitable fostering agency we see it happen every day with our teams of foster carers all over the UK.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we want to highlight that you don’t need to be superhuman, that you don’t need to arrive bursting with childcare skills and experience, and by the very fact that you used to be a nurse, a bus driver, an accountant or a retail manager means that the life experience you bring will only ever augment your role as a foster carer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Let’s look deeper at three areas that could dispel beliefs or myths that foster carers need to be superhuman to make an extraordinary difference:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-tact-brand-gray-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-74cfff63c88cb1a387cd3061f31f3355\" id=\"h-1-coming-from-different-vocational-backgrounds\"><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Coming from different vocational backgrounds</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Whilst there are some specialist <strong><a href=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/start-fostering/types-of-fostering/\">types of foster care</a></strong> that may require previous experience of working with children with additional needs, most fostering types do not require any experience at all. This is because full training is provided.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we can go one step further than that and say that diversity with regards to previous vocational experience is highly sought, and actually achieves two goals:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>1) It makes fostering more accessible to those who don’t have sector experience and who want to make a difference to children’s lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2) It potentially creates wider <strong><a href=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/knowledge-centre/what-is-matching/\">matching</a></strong> opportunities due to foster carers bringing specific life skills and adjacent experiences to the role.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David used to be a bus driver but wanted to do something more fulfilling: “I was a bus driver. I hated it, but I just couldn’t find what I really wanted to do, so I just plodded on driving buses, and generally feeling unfulfilled. Then I saw an advertisement which posed the question: “Could you foster?” and I thought, yes, I probably could. And fortunately, fostering charity TACT Scotland agreed with me, which is why I am now a very proud and very fulfilled full-time dad of four children – foster dad to three siblings, and dad to my birth son.”</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta \">\n\t<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta__inner\">\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta__left\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta__image\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"image-bubble\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2024/06/david-ruth-and-jonas.jpg\" alt=\"Foster carers David and Ruth, with their son Jonas: 'fostering taught me how to share'\" srcset=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2024/06/david-ruth-and-jonas-905x1024.jpg 905w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2024/06/david-ruth-and-jonas-265x300.jpg 265w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2024/06/david-ruth-and-jonas-768x869.jpg 768w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2024/06/david-ruth-and-jonas-1357x1536.jpg 1357w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2024/06/david-ruth-and-jonas.jpg 1368w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"quote-bubble\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<svg width=\"164\" height=\"144\" viewBox=\"0 0 164 144\" fill=\"none\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<path d=\"M33.4844 9.58621C61.8844 -8.81379 93.5 3.92638 109.484 9.58621C184.5 38.9263 175.484 121.086 118.984 138.586C62.4844 156.086 26.9844 122.086 9.48441 88.0863C-8.01559 54.0863 -2.01559 32.5862 33.4844 9.58621Z\" fill=\"white\"/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<path d=\"M90.7797 94.5568C80.2697 82.8104 87.4825 62.2025 96.3438 54.3716C103.763 47.571 116.127 42.0069 117.364 44.0677C119.218 47.1588 112.006 49.2196 106.442 54.1655C99.6411 61.5843 97.3742 64.8816 106.854 69.0031C116.952 73.5369 117.158 78.0706 117.57 83.8408C118.188 98.0602 101.084 104.655 90.7797 94.5568Z\" fill=\"#E11F8F\"/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<path d=\"M51.2119 94.3504C40.7019 82.604 47.9146 61.9961 56.776 54.1652C64.1948 47.3646 76.5595 41.8005 77.796 43.8613C79.6507 46.9524 72.438 49.0133 66.8738 53.9592C60.0733 61.378 57.8064 64.6752 67.286 68.7967C77.3838 73.3305 77.5899 77.8642 78.0021 83.6344C78.6203 97.8538 61.5158 104.448 51.2119 94.3504Z\" fill=\"#E11F8F\"/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</svg>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta__right\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"acf-innerblocks-container\">\n\n<p style=\"font-size:24px\">“Becoming a full-time foster carer has completed my life.

Foster carers aren’t saviours, they are enablers</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>You may have heard fostering agencies or carers use the phrase ‘making a difference’ with regards to providing care for young people.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-tact-white-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-tact-white-background-color has-background is-style-dots\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>The reason why this phrase is used so often is twofold. Firstly it rightly avoids any unrealistic expectations; foster carers are not expected to swoop in and save the day (we have previously said that foster carers are not superhuman). They are there to make a difference to young people who have experienced varying degrees of past trauma. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-tact-white-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-tact-white-background-color has-background is-style-dots\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>This unpicking of current emotional responses caused by trauma experienced in the past is an evolutionary process involving a whole team around a child. A foster carer is not expected to ‘solve’ issues experienced by young people, only to use their training along with specialist expertise from the support network around them, to commence a process of healing.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-tact-white-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-tact-white-background-color has-background is-style-dots\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>Another reason why making a difference is a chosen phrase is to highlight that a foster carer’s role is to <strong>enable</strong> young people to take control of their own lives, to discover new hobbies, to decide what they want to do as a career. Providing a nurturing and caring home environment, where young people can rebuild trust and regain confidence provides them with the tools to start making their own life choices.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-tact-white-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-tact-white-background-color has-background is-style-dots\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>By removing unrealistic expectations from the shoulders of foster carers, we can start to see the most important traits that are required of the role: the ability to provide a safe, nurturing and caring environment to enable young people to thrive and take control of their lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-tact-white-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-tact-white-background-color has-background is-style-dots\"/>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta \">\n\t<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta__inner\">\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta__left\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta__image\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"image-bubble\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2023/06/Yasmin-and-Mohammad-2-e1731513607519.png\" alt=\"Yasmin, who is a TACT foster carer\" srcset=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2023/06/Yasmin-and-Mohammad-2-e1731513607519-1024x821.png 1024w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2023/06/Yasmin-and-Mohammad-2-e1731513607519-300x240.png 300w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2023/06/Yasmin-and-Mohammad-2-e1731513607519-768x616.png 768w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2023/06/Yasmin-and-Mohammad-2-e1731513607519-1536x1231.png 1536w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2023/06/Yasmin-and-Mohammad-2-e1731513607519.png 1940w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"quote-bubble\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<svg width=\"164\" height=\"144\" viewBox=\"0 0 164 144\" fill=\"none\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<path d=\"M33.4844 9.58621C61.8844 -8.81379 93.5 3.92638 109.484 9.58621C184.5 38.9263 175.484 121.086 118.984 138.586C62.4844 156.086 26.9844 122.086 9.48441 88.0863C-8.01559 54.0863 -2.01559 32.5862 33.4844 9.58621Z\" fill=\"white\"/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<path d=\"M90.7797 94.5568C80.2697 82.8104 87.4825 62.2025 96.3438 54.3716C103.763 47.571 116.127 42.0069 117.364 44.0677C119.218 47.1588 112.006 49.2196 106.442 54.1655C99.6411 61.5843 97.3742 64.8816 106.854 69.0031C116.952 73.5369 117.158 78.0706 117.57 83.8408C118.188 98.0602 101.084 104.655 90.7797 94.5568Z\" fill=\"#E11F8F\"/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<path d=\"M51.2119 94.3504C40.7019 82.604 47.9146 61.9961 56.776 54.1652C64.1948 47.3646 76.5595 41.8005 77.796 43.8613C79.6507 46.9524 72.438 49.0133 66.8738 53.9592C60.0733 61.378 57.8064 64.6752 67.286 68.7967C77.3838 73.3305 77.5899 77.8642 78.0021 83.6344C78.6203 97.8538 61.5158 104.448 51.2119 94.3504Z\" fill=\"#E11F8F\"/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</svg>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta__right\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"acf-innerblocks-container\">\n\n<p style=\"font-size:24px\">“By being a foster carer, you’re helping children to have an independent life and support them with the many challenges that they may encounter.

You’ve never heard someone scream so loud as when I gave her the tickets for Christmas!”</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta is-style-rtl\">\n\t<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta__inner\">\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta__left\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta__image\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"image-bubble\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2024/07/James-Alice.png\" alt=\"This is James and Alice, TACT foster carers since 2022\" srcset=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2024/07/James-Alice-1024x676.png 1024w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2024/07/James-Alice-300x198.png 300w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2024/07/James-Alice-768x507.png 768w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2024/07/James-Alice-1536x1014.png 1536w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2024/07/James-Alice-2048x1352.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"quote-bubble\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<svg width=\"164\" height=\"144\" viewBox=\"0 0 164 144\" fill=\"none\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<path d=\"M33.4844 9.58621C61.8844 -8.81379 93.5 3.92638 109.484 9.58621C184.5 38.9263 175.484 121.086 118.984 138.586C62.4844 156.086 26.9844 122.086 9.48441 88.0863C-8.01559 54.0863 -2.01559 32.5862 33.4844 9.58621Z\" fill=\"white\"/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<path d=\"M90.7797 94.5568C80.2697 82.8104 87.4825 62.2025 96.3438 54.3716C103.763 47.571 116.127 42.0069 117.364 44.0677C119.218 47.1588 112.006 49.2196 106.442 54.1655C99.6411 61.5843 97.3742 64.8816 106.854 69.0031C116.952 73.5369 117.158 78.0706 117.57 83.8408C118.188 98.0602 101.084 104.655 90.7797 94.5568Z\" fill=\"#E11F8F\"/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<path d=\"M51.2119 94.3504C40.7019 82.604 47.9146 61.9961 56.776 54.1652C64.1948 47.3646 76.5595 41.8005 77.796 43.8613C79.6507 46.9524 72.438 49.0133 66.8738 53.9592C60.0733 61.378 57.8064 64.6752 67.286 68.7967C77.3838 73.3305 77.5899 77.8642 78.0021 83.6344C78.6203 97.8538 61.5158 104.448 51.2119 94.3504Z\" fill=\"#E11F8F\"/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</svg>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta__right\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"acf-innerblocks-container\">\n\n<p style=\"font-size:24px\">“People often tell us we’re amazing for fostering and I’m never sure how to respond to that.

What matters most is providing a stable, supportive, and caring environment for a child. Many people mistakenly believe that foster carers must possess exceptional skills or qualifications, and be almost superhuman. But it’s the everyday qualities; patience, empathy, reliability, and a willingness to listen that make the biggest difference. Fostering is a learning journey, full of shared discoveries, growth and moments that will make the experience truly rewarding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Children in care benefit most from genuine connections from someone who is present in their lives. Someone who offers encouragement and creates a safe space for them to thrive – enabling them to eventually gain independence and to forge their own path in life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You don’t need to be extraordinary to foster, but conversely the sum total of the everyday care, patience and empathy you provide to young people could make an extraordinary difference.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-tact-brand-light-gray-background-color has-background is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-8cf370e7 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-tact-brand-light-gray-background-color has-background is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-8cf370e7 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-tact-brand-light-gray-background-color has-background\" id=\"start-journey\" style=\"font-size:50px\">Start Your Fostering Journey.

Shortly after that I became a military wife and then I raised my own daughter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One day a friend said to me &#8220;Do you know what, you should have a look at fostering.&#8221; And something clicked. So I decided to do a bit of research. That is basically what brought me to fostering.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The support from TACT East Midlands &#8211; it&#8217;s been spectacular. They&#8217;ve always been good, I’ve felt they&#8217;ve always had my back &#8211; always been there when I needed them. But also, they&#8217;re a nice group of people. I&#8217;ve known them for a long time now.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-tact-brand-gray-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-f45b46014cf324c71126fc4ce6d5e0e2\" id=\"h-a-favourite-memory\">A favourite memory</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A favourite memory with a young person I provided care for is that she and I used to read Harry Potter out loud Harry Potter together. That was our thing. Sometimes we&#8217;d include the rest of the family and we&#8217;d have two copies of the same Harry Potter book. You&#8217;d start reading and you could stop at any point. The person who was there listening had to take over at exactly that point. So it&#8217;s a bit of a game!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a great fun, and the laughter that came out of that! It went on for a long time &#8211; for about three years. Everyday we used to read. It started with just a chapter and then we&#8217;d read for an hour. Her reading skills are much better. She can read for herself now, but sometimes we still do go back to Harry Potter and we read a few chapters out loud because it&#8217;s a nice thing to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-tact-brand-light-blue-background-color has-background is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-8cf370e7 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-8cf370e7 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta \">\n\t<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta__inner\">\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta__left\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta__image\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"image-bubble\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/Kate-TACT-foster-carer-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"This is Kate, TACT foster carer since 2017\" srcset=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/Kate-TACT-foster-carer-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/Kate-TACT-foster-carer-300x200.jpg 300w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/Kate-TACT-foster-carer-768x512.jpg 768w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/Kate-TACT-foster-carer-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/Kate-TACT-foster-carer-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/Kate-TACT-foster-carer-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"quote-bubble\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<svg width=\"164\" height=\"144\" viewBox=\"0 0 164 144\" fill=\"none\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<path d=\"M33.4844 9.58621C61.8844 -8.81379 93.5 3.92638 109.484 9.58621C184.5 38.9263 175.484 121.086 118.984 138.586C62.4844 156.086 26.9844 122.086 9.48441 88.0863C-8.01559 54.0863 -2.01559 32.5862 33.4844 9.58621Z\" fill=\"white\"/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<path d=\"M90.7797 94.5568C80.2697 82.8104 87.4825 62.2025 96.3438 54.3716C103.763 47.571 116.127 42.0069 117.364 44.0677C119.218 47.1588 112.006 49.2196 106.442 54.1655C99.6411 61.5843 97.3742 64.8816 106.854 69.0031C116.952 73.5369 117.158 78.0706 117.57 83.8408C118.188 98.0602 101.084 104.655 90.7797 94.5568Z\" fill=\"#E11F8F\"/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<path d=\"M51.2119 94.3504C40.7019 82.604 47.9146 61.9961 56.776 54.1652C64.1948 47.3646 76.5595 41.8005 77.796 43.8613C79.6507 46.9524 72.438 49.0133 66.8738 53.9592C60.0733 61.378 57.8064 64.6752 67.286 68.7967C77.3838 73.3305 77.5899 77.8642 78.0021 83.6344C78.6203 97.8538 61.5158 104.448 51.2119 94.3504Z\" fill=\"#E11F8F\"/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</svg>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta__right\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"acf-innerblocks-container\">\n\n<p style=\"font-size:24px\">“Everyday we used to read.

She couldn&#8217;t ride a bike and she couldn&#8217;t swim &#8211; although she liked to think she could. So we&#8217;d go out and we would do lots of ball catching games and we would take the bike out and do endless figures of eight &#8211; so she could get the hang of riding a bike and get her balance and all that. We facilitated swimming lessons and then we went and did lots of swimming as a family. Playing ball helped with her motor skills. Doing colouring and baking helped with her fine manipulative skills, and her hand eye coordination; that all helped when she started school.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We used to play board games after tea, and that helped her to focus and to understand turn taking and her understanding of rules.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s putting in place what she never got when she was little. It&#8217;s replacing those skills at a later date because they&#8217;re not instinctive. Now we&#8217;re seeing the fruition of what we put in place early on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At least several times a week we sit down to dinner, we talk about our day &#8211; we talk about what&#8217;s important to us. Is there anything going on in our head that we might need to question or go through? The act of sitting down to dinner, the act of laying the table and eating together and preparing food together &#8211; and then the clearing away and taking turns and being in the same space at the same time; that act really, really changes things. It changes people because it brings everybody together. And it means that you do use the space together &#8211; the space of being a family. Some of these children weren&#8217;t given the opportunity to have a meal, let alone where they had the meal and who they had the meal with.

She wrote a touching letter about her current experience in foster care with her siblings and explained why she hopes she and her siblings remain long-term with their carers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This young person would like to selflessly share her letter with the hope that it will inspire others and show the incredible difference fostering can make in the life of a child or young person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Names have been changed to protect the identity of the young person and foster carers.&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>“Sarah and David are quite literally some of the sweetest people I have ever met. They have always been so caring and supportive since the very first day we arrived, and I have felt like I have already gotten more care and support from them in just a few months than I ever got with my mam in 15 years. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wasn’t very keen on them at the start as I felt like I didn’t fit in. They are social and I wasn’t, they liked going out to places, and I preferred staying at home. And I guess I wasn’t really used to the environment of a nice home and family dinners and showers/baths every night.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My first night, I cried loads. I missed my bed, and I felt like I made a very awful decision. But they made me feel so welcome. The first day, I had a nice relaxing bath, they gave me my space and let us get what we wanted for tea. And honestly, nothing has really changed since that day other than that we are more comfortable around each other, and I am so much happier now that I got the chance to be with such lovely people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ever since the first day, they have always been there for me, no matter what. They are always so caring and helpful. They are so supportive of everything I do. Every time I am upset, they always notice, and they are right on track to figure out what is wrong and try their best to help with the situation. And of course, if I want or need any space, they will respectfully give me some.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not just them, the whole family are the most welcoming, caring and loving people anyone could ever ask for, and I feel like I warmed up to everyone quite fast. Living with them all has made me a better person.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My mental health overall has been so much better than it was while I was with my mam. I have a healthier diet. Sarah and David make sure we are getting proper, nutritious food, instead of fries and chicken nuggets all the time. They also make sure everyone is okay with having that food for tea, and if someone isn’t, then normally small adjustments will be made. For example, when they make Curry, we aren’t that big on spice, so they make us a non-spicy “curry”. (By “we”, I am referring to me and my brothers).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They always buy us things that we need, even if we don’t ask them to. Like one day it can just be brought up in a conversation, then a few days later it arrives. Obviously, they are responsible and try to teach us the value of money, so they don’t just buy us anything we want. If we want something that’s quite pricey or just a silly little thing, then we save up for it. If it is school related, or something crafty, just anything that would get us away from devices, or if its hygiene related, then they will buy it for us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They are quite chill and relaxed and don’t let things people say bother them. They are constantly reminding me that people will just say things out of jealousy or boredom and that I should just ignore what people think or say about me. If they want to do that, then they can go ahead and do it. Why should it be my issue, I know I&#8217;m a good person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whenever I am stressed, they always try their best to help me out as much as they possibly can. There was a moment when I was constantly stressed in school, and it would cause me to scratch my skin. Sarah wasted no time getting me a fidget ring and bracelet to distract me, and she would give me some cream for my wounds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Honestly, I have been such a better, happier and healthier person since living with them, and they have impacted my life in an amazing way. Even people at school have been saying that I look so much better than I used to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also have become a slightly more sociable, confident and productive person and I feel like I get more things done now. And I socialise with people a bit more since we are always going out. I have become more confident with myself, I used to be so insecure and now I don’t let that bother me as much. I’ve even been doing more and better at subjects in school because I don’t have as much stress as I used to when living with my mam. I have been able to hand in my homework on time, get a lot of work done in lessons, and revise properly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They are the reason I am the person I am today.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel like they would have an amazing impact on my future. I will actually have people to talk to about things like what to do when leaving school, how to find a job, how to deal with all sorts of payments, getting a house, college, and university. Just overall, how to be a good person.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel like I will actually have someone to help me through any hard times I have, someone I can actually talk to about things. I am no longer afraid of growing up, because I know that I am surrounded by amazing people who will support me and be there for me through thick and thin.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I lived with my mam, I was constantly afraid of growing up. I wanted to be dead by the age of 16 just so that I didn’t need to live a life like my mams.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sarah and David have given me and my brothers such a safe environment to be in. They have given us the opportunities to experience different things and to explore more things, to figure out what we enjoy doing and what we don’t enjoy doing. They don’t let us give up, but they don’t force us either. They just give us a slight nudge to get us started, then let us continue the rest.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They have made my life so much better in such a small amount of time, and I will forever be grateful to them and their whole family. I will always be grateful for everything they have done for us.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you so much for taking the time out of your day to read my letter. I really appreciate the chance to share a part of my story with you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have an amazing day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sincerely – N”</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Has this letter inspired you to become a foster carer?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>N has beautifully shown within this letter how much of an impact becoming a foster carer can have on a child or young person&#8217;s life.

Adjusting to a new sibling can be a challenge, especially if your child favours routine or isn’t used to sharing their time with you. Struggles with </span><a href=\"https://www.orangegrovefostercare.co.uk/resources/blogs/sibling-jealousy/\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">sibling jealousy</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> may become a factor, there’s a chance that your child may begin to imitate the behaviours of their foster siblings, and it can also be very painful to say goodbye when it’s time for a foster sibling to move on.  </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Having a foster sibling also has tons of benefits – you may begin to see your child come out of their shell more as you help them to build a positive relationship with their new sibling, giving children the chance to build loving relationships which can last a lifetime. Growing up in a foster family can also help to teach skills such as sharing, empathy and compassion for others. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #e87722;\"><b>Which type of fostering is right for me?</b> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">If you’re considering fostering while caring for a child with additional needs, one important factor to think about is which of the </span><a href=\"https://www.orangegrovefostercare.co.uk/about-fostering/types-of-fostering/\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">types of fostering</span></a> <span data-contrast=\"auto\">will be best suited to your family’s needs. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">For example, if your own child has autism, they may thrive better while living with a </span><a href=\"https://www.orangegrovefostercare.co.uk/about-fostering/types-of-fostering/long-term-fostering/\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">long-term foster sibling</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> who will stay with the family until they reach adulthood rather than a style of fostering which involves many different children coming to live with you, such as respite or emergency fostering. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #e87722;\"><b>Do I have capacity to foster a child? </b> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">If your child has any additional needs, such as a physical disability, a neurological condition like Autism or ADHD, a learning disability or mental health struggles, you likely dedicate lots of time, energy and compassion to supporting them day-to-day. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Children who come into care also tend to need extra care and support. Many children in care live with complex developmental trauma as a result of their experiences at home, which can include abuse and neglect. As a foster parent, you’ll also take on lots of additional responsibilities to support your foster child’s wellbeing, such as attending frequent meetings, taking children to visit their birth family and completing daily paperwork.

The vote for quad biking, which none of them had done before, was pretty unanimous!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We took six of our young people to <a href=\"https://www.yorkshire-outdoors.co.uk/\"><strong>Yorkshire Outdoors</strong></a>, who kindly gave us a charity discount, where they got to try quad biking for an hour. The Yorkshire Outdoors staff were amazing with our young people, and kept them safe at all times.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It did get rather wet at times, but everyone really enjoyed biking around the track in the rain!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All our young people had a great time, and it was wonderful to witness them socialising and nurturing friendships made from previous social trips and events. We even managed to talk with them about our <a href=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/why-tact/connect/what-is-tact-connect/\"><strong>Connect</strong></a> community, which they are able to join upon turning 15. All were very excited to sign up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we spoke to our young people about the event, they all thoroughly enjoyed it, but it was the social aspect that they really appreciated:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I can see other children my age. The event was really good, I get to be myself, and I get to see [other] people in care, so I feel included.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I get to make lots of new mates and have fun at the same time.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I feel happy – it makes a difference in my life because I get to see my mates.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bringing our young people together for activities such as this is invaluable from a social point of view. Here at TACT we run multiple events, which means our children get to make new friends, and reconnect with more established friendships that they have previously made.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A big thank you to John Lewis and our Yorkshire and North East staff for enabling this wonderful event!</strong></p>\n\n\n<div class=\"swiper-container\">\n\t<div class=\"swiper\">\n\t\t<div class=\"swiper-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"swiper-slide\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/Quad-bikes-all-in-a-line-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Quad bikes all in a line\" srcset=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/Quad-bikes-all-in-a-line-1024x920.jpg 1024w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/Quad-bikes-all-in-a-line-300x269.jpg 300w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/Quad-bikes-all-in-a-line-768x690.jpg 768w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/Quad-bikes-all-in-a-line-1536x1380.jpg 1536w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/Quad-bikes-all-in-a-line-2048x1839.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"swiper-slide\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/TACT-young-people-quad-biking-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"TACT young people quad biking\" srcset=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/TACT-young-people-quad-biking-1024x824.jpg 1024w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/TACT-young-people-quad-biking-300x242.jpg 300w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/TACT-young-people-quad-biking-768x618.jpg 768w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/TACT-young-people-quad-biking-1536x1237.jpg 1536w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/TACT-young-people-quad-biking-2048x1649.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"swiper-slide\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/TACT-young-receiving-some-quad-bike-instruction-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"TACT young people receiving some quad bike instruction\" srcset=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/TACT-young-receiving-some-quad-bike-instruction-1024x835.jpg 1024w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/TACT-young-receiving-some-quad-bike-instruction-300x245.jpg 300w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/TACT-young-receiving-some-quad-bike-instruction-768x626.jpg 768w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/TACT-young-receiving-some-quad-bike-instruction-1536x1252.jpg 1536w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/TACT-young-receiving-some-quad-bike-instruction-2048x1670.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"swiper-slide\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/TACT-young-person-riding-uphill-on-a-quad-bike-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"TACT young person riding uphill on a quad bike\" srcset=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/TACT-young-person-riding-uphill-on-a-quad-bike-1024x806.jpg 1024w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/TACT-young-person-riding-uphill-on-a-quad-bike-300x236.jpg 300w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/TACT-young-person-riding-uphill-on-a-quad-bike-768x604.jpg 768w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/TACT-young-person-riding-uphill-on-a-quad-bike-1536x1208.jpg 1536w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/TACT-young-person-riding-uphill-on-a-quad-bike-2048x1611.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/news/quad-tastic-event-for-young-people/\">Quad-tastic Event For Our North East Young People</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk\">TACT</a>.</p>",

Andy Elvin, TACT’s CEO and Chair of the <strong><a href=\"https://www.fairerfostering.org.uk/\">Fairer Fostering Partnership</a></strong>, has always been a visual presence in the media, showing that it’s one thing to say that you advocate for children, but it’s another thing to actually do it. Recently, our <strong><a href=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/why-tact/education-service/\">Education Service</a></strong> supported a young person to appeal a decision made by a local authority about whether they had Special Educational Needs (SEN) and required an Individual Development Plan moving forward.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our young person, who has been with her foster carers for 12 years, finished her GCSE’s this year (2025). Although she received additional support whilst at primary school, for some reason this ceased when she started secondary school – despite the fact that she still required this support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With challenges that included struggling to read, telling the time and numeracy, her foster carers were concerned for her future. Along with our team, they had been pushing to get additional educational support for her for a while. That’s when our Education Service stepped in to help.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-tact-brand-gray-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-808ff7ec8fbcb9281f3eeec44db14e74\" id=\"h-from-appeal-to-tribunal\">From Appeal To Tribunal</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When appeal and mediation efforts were unsuccessful, our Head of Education advocated on behalf of our young person and the case was taken to a tribunal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thorough preparation was critical and was a real team effort between our Education Service, Supervising Social Worker and foster carers.&nbsp; As a team, they were able to evidence and demonstrate that our young person met the legal criteria for having additional learning needs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tribunal process, which involved looking at reports and additional information from teachers, social workers, an Educational Psychologist and other professionals, proved that our young person had learning difficulties requiring educational support on a day-to-day basis.&nbsp;It was then agreed that her Individual Development Plan should be reviewed when transitioning into college.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"768\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/08/A-girl-sitting-her-GCSE-exams.jpg\" alt=\"A young person with special educational needs taking an exam\" class=\"wp-image-17366\" srcset=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/08/A-girl-sitting-her-GCSE-exams.jpg 768w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/08/A-girl-sitting-her-GCSE-exams-300x225.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-tact-brand-gray-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-7050dd7815b43f28950b8e1e545eb548\" id=\"h-the-importance-of-educational-advocation\">The importance of educational advocation</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Our Education Service strives to improve the educational experiences of our children and young people. The service not only provides advice, but will attend meetings such as PEPs (Personal Education Plans) or reviews where there are educational concerns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Should any further action be required, such as an Additional Learning Needs appeal, our Education Service can act as a case representative.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Advocation can achieve real results, and can change a young person’s educational landscape for the better. It is highly important that we continue to advocate for children and young people on an individual and national level to raise issues and drive solutions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read more about our <strong><a href=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/why-tact/education-service/\">Education Service</a></strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/advocating-childrens-educational-future/\">Advocating For Our Children’s Educational Future</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk\">TACT</a>.</p>",

Three organisations are selected every three months, and then customers decide how much each organisation receives by using tokens to vote.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>TACT Fostering Cymru received a generous <strong>£2000 via the scheme</strong>, so the team decided to treat our young people to a day out in Llangrannog where they could take part in activities such as karting, archery, high ropes, tobogganing and bushcraft. The activities were followed by an awards ceremony, where each and every young person received an award in celebration of their achievements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The awards ceremony was a highlight for all. Chloe Meades, TACT Fostering Recruitment Manager for Wales and the South West, said: “Seeing all of our children and young people receiving an award for their individual achievements was a highlight for all involved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Also, watching the young people make connections with each other and swap phone numbers to keep in touch was really special.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/08/picture-9-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"The awards ceremony in Llangrannog\" class=\"wp-image-17281\" style=\"width:700px\" srcset=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/08/picture-9-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/08/picture-9-300x225.jpg 300w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/08/picture-9-768x576.jpg 768w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/08/picture-9-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/08/picture-9-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/08/picture-9-800x600.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Wellbeing and activity days have the power to making a lasting positive impression on young people. A TACT foster carer said: “The days out really help all children, and I feel something other people think of as ‘just a day out’ makes so much difference in so many children&#8217;s lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We have seen it first hand and cannot thank you all enough for everything you have provided and done for all our children. Even down to the awards and making each child feel special for their achievements is such a personal and lovely thing.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One particular young person ‘found her feet’ on the trip. Her foster carer said: “Our young person hasn&#8217;t ever been confident and doesn&#8217;t believe in herself at all. But on your planned days out we see a different side to her.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“She pushes herself and really puts herself out there. She’s tried new things and we’ve seen this wave of confidence come over her. It&#8217;s beautiful to see and it makes us feel so proud that she can try new things and be the person we know she is.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other feedback from our foster carers:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We loved the day out and the kids really enjoyed themselves too. The day helps the kids more than anyone would think and not just the foster children but my own children too. Our oldest young person has come out of her shell loads recently and she loves going on your day trips and your weekend trips you have planned. She has made friends with other foster children who can relate to her and her experiences. It&#8217;s been lovely to see her bump into children she has met before. It&#8217;s lovely to see her so happy and comfortable around people she hasn&#8217;t long ago met.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Thank you so much, he hasn’t stopped talking all the way home…he had a wonderful time.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;What a fantastic success the awards day was. Thank you TACT for a brilliant day out &#8211; we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The whole day was fabulous from start to finish. We all had a lovely day and enjoyed all the activities equally. It was so nice seeing everyone having fun. Also the awards was lovely. Even the food was lovely. Thankyou to TACT for arranging this!&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A big ‘thank you’ to the whole of the TACT Fostering Cymru team for organising such a special and memorable day for our young people and foster carers!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read more about <strong><a href=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/location/fostering-in-wales/\">Fostering in Wales</a></strong>.</p>\n\n\n<div

Read our top tips for planning these events, along with 5 activity ideas.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-tact-brand-gray-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-9b14df73264b5117835eea38abdf8705\" id=\"h-planning-ahead-is-key\">Planning ahead is key</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Planning ahead is not only important for high demand ticketed events, it also will ensure that both you and the young people in your household are fully prepared and are on board with any plans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To do this, start by talking to your Supervising Social Worker and all young people in the household.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-talk-to-your-supervising-social-worker\">Talk to your Supervising Social Worker</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Talking about some initial ideas for activities with your Supervising Social Worker is a great start before you talk to young people about potential plans. In addition, some activities may require permissions to be granted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your Supervising Social Worker will be able to provide valuable insight around possible triggers or situations that young people may find activating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, a young person may feel uncomfortable in large crowds, so this will be something to bear in mind when looking at potential activities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may already be aware of what a young person may find ‘activating’ from their Care Plan, but as your Supervising Social Worker will have a direct communication route to a child’s local authority social worker, it’s always a good idea to double check at this stage. This will ensure that you are fully informed and prepared to move onto the next stage: initiating a conversation with your young people and involving them in your planning.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-consulting-young-people\">Consulting young people</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This may sound obvious, but it’s important to highlight what involving young people in your planning will achieve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consulting young people and asking for their input is an important bonding exercise in itself. It will demonstrate that you value their opinions and will nurture feelings of inclusion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of finalising specific plans, you will be fully prepared to guide young people should they suggest any potentially triggering activities that could impact their mental health and wellbeing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When events have been arranged, talking about them regularly could help a young person prepare for them. Some young people can struggle with changes to routines so making sure they are aware that activities are imminent could help alleviate anxiety on the day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If you’re stuck for activities, we have 5 general suggestions for you to investigate with young people in your household.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-tact-brand-gray-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-83481ab46b1f6bde49b6d0d3eb0452b6\" id=\"h-our-5-things-to-do-in-the-summer-holidays\">Our 5 things to do in the summer holidays</h2>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-1-an-extension-of-their-hobbies-or-interests\">1. An extension of their hobbies or interests</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>A good place to start is with young people’s existing hobbies or interests. Looking for activities that are effectively an extension of their established interests could be perfect for them. Having some experience with the activity already, and maybe knowing what to expect, will also be advantageous if they are not used to trying new experiences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if they like football, being taken to a football match could be the perfect suggestion. Could that then lead onto them joining a local football team relevant to their age group?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If they like creative writing, are there any local writing groups or courses available?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Alice and James</strong>, TACT foster carers since 2022, knew that their young person loved musicals – which gave them the perfect idea for a trip away: “Our highlight might be taking a musical-obsessed teenager who had never been to the theatre before to see Hamilton in London. You’ve never heard someone scream so loud as when I gave her the tickets!”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nurturing their hobbies could be invaluable in terms of ongoing future activities, and could play a part in memory making.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-tact-brand-light-blue-background-color has-background is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-8cf370e7 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-8cf370e7 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-9d6595d7 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-2-your-hobbies-could-be-the-springboard\">2. Your hobbies could be the springboard</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Have young people expressed an interest in your hobbies or interests?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For young people to try new experiences with someone that they trust could be a springboard for them to discover a new hobby. You would also be able to provide knowledge, guidance and any necessary equipment. It could also provide another valuable bonding opportunity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Gemma and Jenilee</strong> have been TACT foster carers since 2020.

Encourage creative expression activities</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>As well as providing an activity, getting creative can positively impact a young person’s mental health. This is because creativity can encourage production of dopamine in the brain, commonly known as the ‘feel good neurotransmitter’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dopamine helps regulate how we experience pleasure and rewards. It&#8217;s closely linked to our ability to think, plan, and stay motivated. It also plays a key role in helping us focus and work towards goals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Creativity can take many forms. It could be creative writing, making music, producing some art, dancing or even experimenting in the kitchen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://blog.calm.com/blog/creativity-mental-health\"><strong>Calm</strong></a>, “Research has shown that engaging in creative activities like music, dance, painting, or even crafting is linked to lower levels of anxiety and depression. Creative arts often provide a sense of connection, whether through sharing your work with others or simply feeling more in tune with yourself. It’s not about being good at something. Instead, it’s about allowing yourself to explore and create freely.”</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-tact-brand-light-blue-background-color has-background is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-8cf370e7 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-8cf370e7 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-9d6595d7 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:45%\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"682\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/07/Young-person-baking-682x1024.jpg\" alt=\"A young person baking is one of our things to do in the Summer Holidays\" class=\"wp-image-17156\" style=\"aspect-ratio:1;object-fit:cover\" srcset=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/07/Young-person-baking-682x1024.jpg 682w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/07/Young-person-baking-200x300.jpg 200w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/07/Young-person-baking-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/07/Young-person-baking.jpg 853w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 682px) 100vw, 682px\" /></figure>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:5%\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-4-create-theme-days\">4. Create ‘theme days’</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a straightforward idea that will require young people to be on board at the planning stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Ask them to come up with a list of activities that end in the word ‘day’, that can be achieved in the home. For example, ‘pizza day’, ‘film day’ or ‘treasure hunt day’. Working with the young person, you will be able to carefully advise or guide them on any activities that could be logistically impossible for your time or resources.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Get a calendar and ask them to write in when they would like to do each activity.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Be flexible with the calendar</strong>. If a young person doesn’t feel like doing a particular activity, explain that they can swap it for another and that the calendar is not set in stone.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Generating theme days is an excellent way of filling up long stretches of holiday time. Young people are fully involved in the planning and scheduling, encouraging responsibility and ownership.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-5-documenting-the-summer-holidays\">5. Documenting the summer holidays</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This one involves recording or documenting the entire summer holiday break using a medium chosen by the young person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, they could take photographs, write a story &#8211; or for the more technically minded, create and edit together a video.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compiling a scrapbook or collage to consolidate the summer holidays will not only provide an activity in itself, but will be something tangible for young people to look back on and remember.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If a video format was chosen, ensure that you take the time to watch the video back with them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-tact-brand-gray-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-a221d5eef1866e22a3839eea7106ed2a\" id=\"h-our-engagement-amp-activity-practitioners\">Our Engagement &amp; Activity Practitioners</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At TACT, our <a href=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/young-people-practitioners/\"><strong>Engagement &amp; Activity Practitioners (EAPs)</strong></a> help organise activities for our young people in the summer holiday period.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some examples of upcoming activities are trips to the zoo, a visit to an aqua park, a Go Ape day, a trip to a museum and a picnic in the park. Larger events include a trip to Colwyn Bay, and FoxFest &#8211; where our young people will experience Ed Sheeran and Taylor Swift tribute acts! Aimed at all young people in our fostering households, including carer’s own children, the activities cover various age groups and abilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>EAPs also organise one-to-one activities, such as trips to the circus, mini golf, bowling and local farm visits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our EAPs also signpost to activities over the summer, highlighting any special deals and offers via a newsletter. We find that this can help alleviate pressure on our foster carers to generate a whole programme of events for their young people during the summer holidays.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>No matter how you choose to approach the school summer holidays, it’s important to remember that not every day needs to be packed with activities or events. Young people benefit from having quiet time to rest, recharge, and adjust to the change in routine during the break from school.</strong></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/things-to-do-in-the-summer-holidays/\">5 Things To Do In The Summer Holidays</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk\">TACT</a>.</p>",

It was the first time two separate weekends were arranged to make travel easier, and the first time Centre Parcs was used as the venue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Centre Parcs turned out to be the perfect setting, with accessible lodges and a huge range of activities for the children to try out. The relaxed environment gave families the chance to spend quality time together and create some lovely memories.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"694\" src=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/07/Young-People-At-Centre-Parcs-1024x694.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-17040\" style=\"width:700px\" srcset=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/07/Young-People-At-Centre-Parcs-1024x694.png 1024w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/07/Young-People-At-Centre-Parcs-300x203.png 300w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/07/Young-People-At-Centre-Parcs-768x520.png 768w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/07/Young-People-At-Centre-Parcs.png 1138w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Feedback from carers was really positive, with many expressing how much they appreciated TACT living its values and giving children and carers the chance to enjoy something a little different:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&#8220;I wish to thank TACT for arranging myself and the young person to attend Sherwood Forest Centre Parc. We had a great time. This was our first time and we enjoyed every minute of the stay, and taking part in the different activities and food. Thanks once again.&#8221;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&#8220;We really cannot thank you enough for such a wonderfully amazing experience.&nbsp;Centre Parcs had so much on offer and the surroundings full of nature and peace.&nbsp;You all put in such consideration to meeting the needs of everybody who went and especially the children with disabilities.&nbsp;The use of the electric bed and the adapted kitchen were brilliant, as DH could easily assist in a preparing meals and had the independence of getting in and out of bed, and making her way to the adapted bathroom with ease.&nbsp;Getting around with wheelchair was easy as there were plenty of pathways on the grounds, and a tonne of activities on site.&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&#8220;We also enjoyed the restaurant options too!  Some of us carers met up for lunch which was nice and everybody seemed relaxed, enjoying the scenery.  TACT went above and beyond for the children with disabilities, my mother who came to support us was so impressed with what you did for CWD, she had said she will be encouraging any current foster carer and any potential foster carer to look into TACT.&#8221;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A huge thank you to our <strong><a href=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/location/fostering-in-yorkshire/\">Yorkshire</a></strong> and the <a href=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/location/fostering-in-north-east/\"><strong>North East</strong></a> team, whose hard work made these weekends such a success.

I thought secondary school was meant to be fun? The same laughs, same fingers pointing. At me. This is the reflection of a mirror broken years ago. Every break, every shatter the mirror multiplies but never breaks. The unbuilt anger sears my skin as my mind casts all the mistakes and regrets. I look around and notice the smiles. The unfazed and unscarred smiles. Weird glances are casted my way and I feel that numb feeling spread through my chest. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-tact-white-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-tact-white-background-color has-background is-style-dots\"/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">New year, new me right? I mean the start of Year 10 and I sit alone with mascara and lip-gloss on hoping someone will talk to me. They never do. I open my phone. No new messages. I sigh but keep that smile plastered on my face. A girl. A new friend? We talk. She’s nice. I feel the candle start to melt, oh no. There it goes wax over wax until it’s all spilt and a new cast is formed. The girl’s face twists and contorts to reveal an empty reflection. Her face opens up and she spreads her lies and more people shift away from me. I want to shout but my tongue has sealed in my mouth. Why can’t I be loved? She spits her venom and leaves me all alone. Everyday repeats the same. She spits more words and the makeup gets thicker, clothes get baggier and hair gets shorter. I can feel the fuse about to snap so I drown it in lighter fluid. I cry and beg till I am shifted to a new school. A new reality.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-tact-white-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-tact-white-background-color has-background is-style-dots\"/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center has-large-font-size\">Chapter 2</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-tact-white-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-tact-white-background-color has-background is-style-dots\"/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">I am liked. I sit at tables full of people but the hollow feeling remains. The poison of my mother’s voice creates a wave of anger and resentment radiates off my bones. People talk to me but don’t want to know me. The fuse is short and constantly drowned but the mind never shuts down. The constant flow of toxicity and despair suffocates you from the inside. Another school year comes to a close but the events of a childhood misplaced never leaves and constantly reminds you of all the regrets. Time doesn’t heal, your mind does. Cut the fuse, freeze the wax.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-tact-white-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-tact-white-background-color has-background is-style-dots\"/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center has-large-font-size\">The End</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-tact-white-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-tact-white-background-color has-background is-style-dots\"/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Moral of the story: trauma doesn’t go away, it makes you who you are.</strong></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/young-persons-short-story/\">Made of Glass: A Young Person’s Short Story</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk\">TACT</a>.</p>",

Foster care meetings help every professional involved in a child&#8217;s care understand how a child is getting on in the foster home, at school, and during family time arrangements.</p>\n<p>They are a chance to raise concerns, share successes, and make any changes needed to better support the child. They also help you access extra support, whether that’s training, guidance, or specialist services.</p>\n<p>While the idea of regular meetings might feel a little daunting at first, fostering is all about teamwork, and with the right support around you, both you and the child in your care can thrive.</p>\n                    </div>\n\n                    <div class=\"media\">\n                <div class=\"img-wrapper\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"540\" height=\"405\" src=\"https://www.orangegrovefostercare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/shutterstock_381106489.jpg\" class=\"attachment-half-width-desktop size-half-width-desktop\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.orangegrovefostercare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/shutterstock_381106489.jpg 540w, https://www.orangegrovefostercare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/shutterstock_381106489-365x274.jpg 365w, https://www.orangegrovefostercare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/shutterstock_381106489-176x132.jpg 176w, https://www.orangegrovefostercare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/shutterstock_381106489-397x298.jpg 397w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px\" /></div>\n            </div>\n            </div>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"content-block-block_2308a44d4179b28820dfa994dc7ec44b\" class=\"custom-block content-block alignfull has-none-background-color theme-leaves-green spacing-top-half spacing-bottom-half width-full\" data-columns=\"1\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n\n                    <div class=\"content\">\n                <h2><span style=\"color: #51ae32;\">What types of meetings do foster parents attend?</span></h2>\n<p>As a foster parent, you’ll attend various meetings. Each meeting has a clear purpose, and different professionals will attend depending on the type of meeting. Some happen every month, while others every six months, and some may only take place if there is an issue or concern. Here is a breakdown of foster care meetings in more detail.</p>\n<h3><span style=\"color: #e87722;\">Placement Planning <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Meetings</span></span></h3>\n<h4>How often is the meeting held?</h4>\n<p>A placement planning meeting is held within 72 hours of a child moving into your home.</p>\n<h4>Who will attend?</h4>\n<p>Foster parents and your supervising social worker, the child&#8217;s local authority (LA) social worker, and the child depending on their age. Sometimes, other professionals, such as the child’s teacher, may attend.</p>\n<h4>What is the purpose of the meeting?</h4>\n<p>During a placement planning meeting, attendees will discuss and agree on the child&#8217;s placement plan. This helps everyone involved in the child&#8217;s care to understand their needs and ensures that both you and the child have the support required to meet them.</p>\n<p>Examples of details discussed in a placement planning meeting include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Why is the child in care?</li>\n<li>What is their legal status, and who has parental responsibility?</li>\n<li>How long is the placement expected to last?</li>\n<li>How is the child&#8217;s physical, emotional, and mental well-being? This includes their medical history, health conditions, medication, and allergies.</li>\n<li>What are the child&#8217;s emotional and behavioural needs?</li>\n<li>Does the child have any specific identity needs? For example, cultural, religious, or language.</li>\n<li>Which school does the child attend, and when is their Personal Education Plan (PEP) meeting scheduled?</li>\n<li>Who has delegated authority for particular decisions?</li>\n<li>What will their daily routines look like? For example, mealtimes and bedtimes.</li>\n<li>What family time arrangements are in place? Including frequency, venue, transport, and who will supervise.</li>\n<li>What support will the child and foster parent need, and when will they receive it? For example, how often will the child&#8217;s social worker visit?</li>\n</ul>\n\n                            </div>\n        \n            </div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div id=\"content-block-banner-block-block_e8776062bed25231cc13c801acbe150f\" class=\"custom-block content-block-banner-block alignfull  theme-none has-dark-orange-background-color has-dark-background spacing-top-full spacing-bottom-full order-media-last mobile-order-media-first\" data-emergence=\"hidden\">\n    <div class=\"content\">\n\n                    <div class=\"media\">\n                <div class=\"img-wrapper\">\n                    <img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"960\" height=\"384\" src=\"https://www.orangegrovefostercare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/orange-grove-enquiry-brochure-image-for-website.webp\" class=\"attachment-full-screen size-full-screen\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.orangegrovefostercare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/orange-grove-enquiry-brochure-image-for-website.webp 960w, https://www.orangegrovefostercare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/orange-grove-enquiry-brochure-image-for-website-365x146.webp 365w, https://www.orangegrovefostercare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/orange-grove-enquiry-brochure-image-for-website-875x350.webp 875w, https://www.orangegrovefostercare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/orange-grove-enquiry-brochure-image-for-website-176x70.webp 176w, https://www.orangegrovefostercare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/orange-grove-enquiry-brochure-image-for-website-768x307.webp 768w, https://www.orangegrovefostercare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/orange-grove-enquiry-brochure-image-for-website-625x250.webp 625w, https://www.orangegrovefostercare.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/orange-grove-enquiry-brochure-image-for-website-952x381.webp 952w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" />                </div>\n            </div>\n                <div class=\"text\">\n            <div class=\"container\">\n                                <h3>Start your fostering journey here</h3>\n<p>Download our brochure and discover everything you need to know about fostering with Orange Grove.</p>\n                                    <div class=\"wp-block-buttons is-content-justification-left\">\n                                                    <div class=\"wp-block-button  \">\n                                <a href=\"/guide-to-fostering/\" class=\"wp-block-button__link\" >DOWNLOAD GUIDE</a>\n                            </div>\n                                            </div>\n                            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"content-block-block_99f93606c61f26322b6a18d77f679d1c\" class=\"custom-block content-block alignfull has-none-background-color theme-none spacing-top-full spacing-bottom-none width-full\" data-columns=\"2\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n\n        \n                    <div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n                                    <div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n                        <h3><span style=\"color: #e87722;\">Looked After Child (LAC) <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Reviews</span></span></h3>\n<h4>How often is the meeting held?</h4>\n<p>A Looked After Child (LAC) review, which is sometimes known as a Child Looked After (CLA) review, will take place within the first month of a child being in your care, again 3 months later, and then every 6 months after that.</p>\n<h4>Who will attend?</h4>\n<p>LAC reviews are led by an independent reviewing officer (IRO) who is independent of the child&#8217;s social work team within the local authority. Foster parents and your supervising social worker, the child&#8217;s LA social worker, and sometimes the child will attend. Other professionals involved in the child&#8217;s care, such as a psychologist, teacher, or health professional, may also join the meeting.</p>\n<h4>What is the purpose of the meeting?</h4>\n<p>The purpose of LAC reviews is to gain an overview of how a child is progressing in their foster home. The IRO will assess the child&#8217;s overall well-being and circumstances, taking the child’s views into account by speaking to them alone, either before or after the meeting.</p>\n<p>During LAC meetings, the IRO will review and update the child&#8217;s care plan to ensure it continues to meet the child&#8217;s needs.

The first PEP meeting will take place within the first month of a child moving into care.</p>\n<h4>Who will attend?</h4>\n<p>PEP meetings are usually led by the child&#8217;s designated teacher or a member of the SENCO team. The virtual school head, foster parents, your supervising social worker, the child’s LA social worker, and sometimes the child will attend, along with other relevant professionals involved in the child’s care.</p>\n<h4>What is the purpose of the meeting?</h4>\n<p>PEP meetings focus on the child’s education. They help everyone involved in the child’s care understand how they’re doing at school and identify whether they would benefit from any additional support. Details covered during a PEP meeting may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The child&#8217;s attendance record.</li>\n<li>Feedback from teachers.</li>\n<li>Academic achievements and concerns.</li>\n<li>Identifying any additional support needed from the SENCO team.</li>\n<li>Listening to the child’s views to understand how they feel about school.</li>\n<li>Reviewing how Pupil Premium funding is being used to support the child, such as for art therapy or additional tutoring.</li>\n<li>Support the child will receive if they&#8217;re transitioning from primary to secondary school or moving to a school in a different area.</li>\n</ul>\n\n                                            </div>\n                            </div>\n            \n                        </div>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"content-block-block_4e8f2e0f9d78d7b6e6d8c25f92415a05\" class=\"custom-block content-block alignfull has-none-background-color theme-leaves-green spacing-top-half spacing-bottom-none width-full\" data-columns=\"1\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n\n                    <div class=\"content\">\n                <h3><span style=\"color: #e87722;\">Supervision <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Meetings</span></span></h3>\n<h4>How often is the meeting held?</h4>\n<p>Supervision meetings take place once a month or more often if needed. You’ll also have two unannounced visits per year.</p>\n<h4>Who will attend?</h4>\n<p>Your supervising social worker will visit you and the child in your care at home. If you’re fostering as a couple and the secondary foster parent is unable to attend supervision every month, they must attend at least once every three months.</p>\n<h4>What is the purpose of the meeting?</h4>\n<p>Supervision meetings give your supervising social worker (SSW) insight into how things are going within the foster home. They ensure that both you and the child in your care receive the support you need.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re fostering with children of your own, your supervising social worker will also check in with them and make sure they feel happy and settled within the foster home too.</p>\n<p>During your first supervision meeting, your SSW will:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ask you how you found your assessment and panel.</li>\n<li>Discuss foster care training in more detail.</li>\n<li>Talk to you about your Training, Support, and Development (TSD) Standards workbook.</li>\n<li>Let you know what you can expect from future supervisions.</li>\n<li>Deliver basic CHARMS training.</li>\n<li>Spend time getting to know you and your family.</li>\n<li>Discuss initial matching and welcoming your first child – including asking whether your foster parent profile is up to date, if you’ve created a welcome book and whether you’ve had contact with the referrals team.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When a child is in your care, you&#8217;ll have a supervision meeting with your supervising social worker once a month.

Other professionals may also be invited. Your first review will be presented to a fostering panel.</p>\n<h4><strong>What is the purpose of the meeting?</strong></h4>\n<p>Foster carer review meetings assess your progress as a foster parent, making sure you can continue to meet the needs of children in care and that a change in your circumstances won’t impact your ability to foster.</p>\n<p>It also gives you a chance to reflect on your fostering journey so far and request any further support, training, and guidance.</p>\n<p>Your first annual review will be presented to the panel, who’ll make a recommendation about your continued approval to foster.</p>\n<h4><strong>What happens at a foster care review board meeting?</strong></h4>\n<p>Before the meeting, your supervising social worker will prepare a foster care report.

Your supervising social worker will guide you through what to expect and make sure you feel prepared.</p>\n<p>You will usually just need a notepad, pen, or laptop, and your supervising social worker will handle most of the notetaking.</p>\n<p>Remember, you’re the child’s advocate. If there is something they are struggling to say, it’s okay to speak up on their behalf. These meetings are part of making sure every child has the best possible outcomes and achieves their goals.</p>\n<h4 aria-level=\"2\"><span data-ccp-parastyle=\"heading 2\">Join our fostering community today</span></h4>\n<p>Interested in <a href=\"/about-fostering/how-to-become-a-foster-parent/\"><span data-ccp-charstyle=\"Hyperlink\">becoming a foster parent</span></a>?

Rather than happiness and warmth, Christmastime can make foster children feel confusion, loneliness, anger and even guilt &#8211; all of which can manifest in unfavourable behaviours, especially when the child cannot fully articulate their emotions.</p>\n<p>These negative feelings can come from an infinite number of sources. Your social worker should have made you aware of any particular reasons why your foster child may dislike Christmas, but just the thought of being away from their biological family at a very family-oriented time of year can be enough to cast a dark cloud over the festivities. To make Christmas as enjoyable as can be for your foster child, keep these steps in mind as you navigate the tricky festive season.</p>\n<div class=\"c-cta-bar c-cta-bar--default c-cta-bar--background-pink\"><div class=\"c-cta-bar__caption\">Start your fostering journey today</div><div class=\"c-cta-bar__link\"><a href=\"/thinking-about-fostering/can-i-foster/\" class=\"nfa-button nfa-button--orange nfa-button--right-arrow\" target=\"\">Can I foster?</a></div></div>\n<p><strong>Take time to listen and understand their worries</strong></p>\n<p>If you notice your foster child becoming upset, the first thing you should do – as at any time of year – is encourage them to tell you why. This will take time, but once you reassure them that nothing bad will happen as a result of them speaking honestly, their thoughts should start to trickle out.</p>\n<p>You may discover that there is something about Christmas that they find particularly ‘triggering’, which you can address or remove. They might be wondering what is happening to their family while they are having a nice time. It may be that they simply aren’t used to having a Christmas at all, and they are feeling completely overwhelmed. Be patient, let them speak, and you’re taking a big step closer to a happy Christmas with your foster child.</p>\n<p><strong>Arrange suitable contact with their family, if appropriate</strong></p>\n<p>Depending on your foster child’s individual situation it may be possible to arrange special contact with their family members around Christmas.</p>\n<p>This could be anything from a pre-arranged Skype call on Christmas Day, a ‘Christmas party’ at a face-to-face contact session, or even an invitation to the child’s school nativity performance; the contact will all depend on what is appropriate for the child, but the opportunity to share the celebrations will be beneficial for both the child and their family.</p>\n<p><strong>Make sure they’re a part of the preparations</strong></p>\n<p>Your Christmas celebrations and traditions may be very different to those that your foster child has experienced before. Before Christmas gets into full swing, take time to explain to them how you typically celebrate so they know exactly what to expect, and give them plenty of opportunities to be involved.</p>\n<p>From choosing which snacks you eat on Christmas Day to decorating the tree, picking out presents or even writing on gift tags, there are countless ways that foster children can feel part of your family’s Christmas. This will not only make them feel welcome, but also give them a sense of purpose and control that they may not have experienced before.</p>\n<p><strong>Reassure your foster child that Santa can still find them</strong></p>\n<p>A very real fear for young foster children is that Santa Claus will not be able to find them in their current home. If your foster child still believes in Santa, take the opportunity to reassure them that he always knows where they are – and he will absolutely be paying them a visit on Christmas morning.</p>\n<p>To help them believe this, you could write a letter to Santa with them, take them to your local shopping centre to visit him in his Grotto, or even look online at a ‘Santa Tracker’ that shows where he is in the world.</p>\n<p><strong>Give all of your children an equal amount of gifts</strong></p>\n<p>Naturally, a foster child may expect that their Christmas gifts won’t match up to those of their foster brothers or sisters. Buy all of the children in your household gifts of equal value and quantity to prevent anyone from feeling ‘left out’ or less important.</p>\n<p>In addition to this, make it clear to your foster child that their gifts are theirs to keep, and they will be able to take them to their next home. If you’re wondering what to buy for your foster child this Christmas, their social worker should be able to give you some tips.</p>\n<p><strong>Remember the difference you can make</strong></p>\n<p>Christmas might feel difficult for your foster child and for you, but try to remember the difference you can make with time, patience and understanding. The video below was created by one of our foster children, sharing how Christmas is special again for them thanks to the support of their foster family.</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"Christmas time - In the words of a foster child\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/COmIfkGaTzs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>Interested in fostering?</strong></p>\n<p>Would you like to make a difference to a child or young person at Christmas?

      "content": "<p>You’ll find that on your fostering journey, you’ll more than likely come across the Secure Base model. By implementing its principles, you’ll foster healthy attachment and relationship skills in the children you care for.</p>\n<p>This is key, particularly for foster children who’ve had traumatic experiences that have resulted in them being placed into foster care. To help you understand what the Secure Base model is, we’ve broken it down so you can use it to be the best foster parent you can be.</p>\n<h2>What is the Secure Base model?</h2>\n<p>The Secure Base model is a framework for foster parents and other carers. Its purpose is to promote certain behaviours, known as ‘dimensions’, in caregivers so children exhibit a secure and <a href=\"https://www.nfa.co.uk/news-and-blog/introduction-to-attachment-and-foster-care-joe-nee/\">healthy attachment style</a>. By following the framework and practising each of the five dimensions where appropriate, foster parents and other caregivers will provide a positive and healthy experience of family life for the children in their care.</p>\n<h3>The five dimensions of the Secure Base model</h3>\n<p>The model is composed of five dimensions that together provide a secure base for children. Each of the different dimensions has its role. Collectively, they form a consistent, stable and nurturing environment that helps the child feel safe and supported. The five dimensions are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Availability</strong> &#8211; Helping the child to trust.</li>\n<li><strong>Sensitivity</strong> &#8211; Helping the child to manage feelings.</li>\n<li><strong>Acceptance</strong> &#8211; Building the child’s self-esteem.</li>\n<li><strong>Co-operation</strong> &#8211; Helping the child to feel effective.</li>\n<li><strong>Family Membership</strong> &#8211; Helping the child to belong.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-9043\" src=\"https://www.nfa.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Secure-Model-of-Care-300x241.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"183\" height=\"147\" srcset=\"https://www.nfa.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Secure-Model-of-Care-300x241.jpg 300w, https://www.nfa.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Secure-Model-of-Care.jpg 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 183px) 100vw, 183px\" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Availability &#8211; helping the child to trust</h4>\n<p>The first dimension, availability, is about being emotionally and physically present. Being available goes a long way in encouraging a child to trust. It’s the first step towards helping a child feel safe and secure in your presence, and that they matter. Some ways you can show emotional and physical availability are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Acknowledge and validate their emotions when they open up.</li>\n<li>Make time for quality conversations where it helps you understand each other.</li>\n<li>Be vulnerable about your own fears, insecurities and experiences.</li>\n<li>Reach out to them when they’re not around and ask about their day.</li>\n<li>Celebrate their successes and empathise with them when they’re disappointed.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Sensitivity &#8211; helping the child to manage feelings</h4>\n<p>Sensitivity is the second dimension and is about helping the child to manage their feelings. As their foster carer, it’s important to tune into your child’s thoughts and feelings. By validating and understanding them, you put yourself in their shoes. You ensure they’re heard and understood, and can then guide them to categorising and labelling their emotions.</p>\n<p>The opportunity to explore their feelings in a safe and loving environment may never have occurred in their life before. Allowing and encouraging your foster child to express themselves will help them overcome stressful events, and manage their emotions when a similar situation arises.</p>\n<h4>Acceptance &#8211; building the child’s self-esteem</h4>\n<p>Building a child’s self-esteem is at the heart of the third dimension, acceptance. This means accepting and valuing the child for who they are, as it’s not uncommon for foster children to have difficulty with their self-esteem. They could be struggling with issues surrounding how they look, their academic abilities, the background they&#8217;ve come from, their current circumstances or how they might think they’re different to other children.</p>\n<p>As their foster parent, you can help here by finding areas of success in your foster child’s lives and celebrate them. This could be anything from doing well in school, at sports or even taking the family dog for a walk. By celebrating their achievements, they’ll gain confidence within themselves as they feel more competent. Some ways you can celebrate their achievements are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reward and treat them to something small.</li>\n<li>Express your gratitude for what they’ve achieved, particularly if it impacts you or your family as a whole.</li>\n<li>Do something fun like taking them to the cinema or venturing outdoors for a football game.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Co-operation &#8211; helping the child to feel effective</h4>\n<p>The fourth dimension of the Secure Base model is co-operation. This will help your foster child feel effective and competent in their own lives and learn to ask for help when needed. To foster co-operative caregiving, look for ways where you can help your foster child make choices and encourage them to take action upon those choices.</p>\n<p>While we are faced with daily choices, you may need to create opportunities where a choice will have to be made. These opportunities may push them slightly out of their comfort zone but, in turn, will help them feel a sense of accomplishment once they take action.</p>\n<p>Remember, the purpose of co-operative parenting is to teach them that both independent and dependent behaviour are appropriate so long as the right balance is struck. Therefore, it’s important that the situations and choices you present offer an avenue for each.</p>\n<h4>Family membership &#8211; helping the child to belong</h4>\n<p>Helping your foster child feel a sense of belonging to your family is the fifth and final dimension of the Secure Base model. It’s an essential part of a child’s feeling of security as they grow up.</p>\n<p>Foster children in particular, will have had a lot of family-type relationships in their lives due to their past and current circumstances. With that in mind, it’s important for you as their foster parent to understand their family history. You should also encourage them to keep in touch with any family both within their current foster family and outside of it. Keeping in contact with their current and former caregivers creates a sense of belonging, security and identity as they become more independent.</p>\n<h2>Why the Secure Base model is important for foster children</h2>\n<p>Children who come into foster care will often have experienced difficult times in their birth families. They will all have experienced loss and separation from familiar people, places and circumstances. Foster children will also likely have experienced abuse, drug misuse, domestic violence and neglect.</p>\n<p>For this reason, we have 3 levels of Therapeutic Parenting Training available to our foster carers &#8211; Introduction, Foundation and Advanced. This is because we know that foster children of all ages need <a href=\"https://www.nfa.co.uk/thinking-about-fostering/what-is-therapeutic-fostering/\">therapeutic care from foster carers</a> and foster families. Therapeutic care helps them recover from harmful experiences and find happiness, fulfilment and a sense of safety and security.</p>\n<p>The Secure Base model is one of the many therapeutic approaches foster carers use to help their children trust and bond with them. It’s often seen as a cornerstone for therapeutic caregiving, and without it, children will often grow up with <a href=\"https://www.nfa.co.uk/news-and-blog/coping-with-attachment-disorder-in-children/\">insecure attachment styles</a> like anxious or avoidant attachment. They will also have trust issues and difficulty managing their thoughts and emotions. On a social level, they’ll struggle to form and maintain relationships and friendships.</p>\n<p>Because of this, foster carers often refer to the Secure Base model, as they want the children in their care to have a healthy relationship with both themselves and others. Building confidence, resilience, and emotional control puts their foster children in good stead for opportunities that will present themselves throughout their lives.</p>\n<h2>Can you make a difference?</h2>\n<p>Around the country, dozens of children enter the care system every day &#8211; children who can’t live at home through no fault of their own.

      "content": "<p>Burnout can be a real concern for anyone. But with foster carers, it can cause even more problems. As a foster carer, you are dealing with extra risks, as not only can burnout impact you, but your foster children too. The last thing you want is to feel overwhelmed, and for you and your foster children to feel the effects of that as you do your best to cope.</p>\n<p>Knowing what the main causes of burnout are not only means you can manage it better when you start to feel the warning signs. With this knowledge, you will also be able to spot the signs in your foster children too, who just like adults, can experience burnout too. The tell-tale signs of burnout.</p>\n<p>Burnout is often interchanged with the term exhaustion. The common signs of burnout include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Feeling constantly tired or drained</li>\n<li>Feeling detached</li>\n<li>Having thoughts of self-doubt and a cynical, negative outlook on life</li>\n<li>Taking longer than usual to complete tasks and procrastinating instead</li>\n<li>Feeling helpless or trapped</li>\n<li>Feeling overwhelmed</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Although helpful for your own well-being, it would be difficult to see these feelings in another person, like your foster child.</p>\n<p>Burnout in foster children is often caused by their traumatic experiences, along with difficulty to cope. This is why it’s important to recognise the signs of burnout in your foster child, so you can take the right steps to help them. Some common signs of burnout to look for in foster children are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Procrastination</li>\n<li>Avoiding situations like social gatherings</li>\n<li>Anxiety or fear</li>\n<li>Negative attitude</li>\n<li>Restlessness, including not being able to sleep</li>\n<li>Trouble focusing</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What causes foster carers to experience burnout?</h2>\n<p>A state of physical and emotional exhaustion, burnout can occur when you experience long-term stress. Because it’s built up over a long period, the question remains what are the root causes of burnout for foster carers?</p>\n<h3>1. Caring for children with challenging behaviour</h3>\n<p>Foster children are complex individuals, they have had experiences that not the typical child will have experienced like a turbulent and unsettling upbringing. Sometimes, these experiences express themselves through more challenging behaviour.</p>\n<p>Examples of challenging behaviour include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Regular angry outbursts or ‘tantrums’.</li>\n<li>Frequent aggressive behaviour that can manifest itself as kicking, hitting, smashing objects or damaging things.</li>\n<li>Impulsive behaviour like impulse buying or blurting something out.</li>\n<li>Risk-taking.</li>\n<li>Not sticking to routines or boundaries you have set.</li>\n<li>Ostracising themselves from conversations and group settings.</li>\n<li>Troublesome behaviour at school like bullying.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While we must understand and sympathise with why these behaviours are occurring, unfortunately, they are more challenging for foster carers to deal with, which can take a toll on their well-being by becoming increasingly stressed.</p>\n<h3>2. Money worries</h3>\n<p>Even with the fostering allowance for foster carers, we can experience anxiety over our finances. So much so in fact that money worries could contribute to long-term stress and experiencing burnout.</p>\n<p>Managing your finances by monitoring and budgeting, as well as getting financial advice, are all good steps to take if you’re experiencing financial anxiety. Moreover, we encourage you as a foster carer to discuss your financial worries with your social worker, who will discuss with you the next steps and what you can do to put yourself in a better position financially.</p>\n<h3>3. Unhealthy relationships</h3>\n<p>The quality of your relationships has a direct impact on your well-being. Poor relationships can cause not just yourself, but anyone around you, stress and restlessness. As a foster parent, it’s important to foster a healthy relationship with your foster child and your partner too.</p>\n<p>Doing the things that contribute to a healthy relationship, not only improves the well-being of your foster child, but yourself too. Of course one of the primary things to remember when looking to build a healthy relationship between you and your foster child is to implement PACE (playfulness, acceptance, curiosity and empathy) which help them co-regulate.</p>\n<p>Another important step to take to build a healthy relationship is to create clear boundaries and predictable routines so they know what to expect.</p>\n<p>With that being said, more ways you can foster a healthy relationship with your foster child are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ask their opinion on things and listen to their thoughts and points of view</li>\n<li>Allow them to choose some things like what to do at the weekend lets them know you value what they enjoy</li>\n<li>Letting them take appropriate risks for their age and allowing them some independence</li>\n<li>Take part in fun activities you can do together like painting workshops, bike rides or hikes</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nfa.co.uk/news-and-blog/the-benefits-of-taking-foster-children-with-you-on-holiday/\">Go on holiday with your foster children</a> and experience new places, food and cultures together</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>4. Neglecting self-care</h3>\n<p>Not taking time out for yourself, can make you feel unfulfilled and in the long run, stressed. Self-care can mean different things for everyone, but the crux of self-care really is taking time out to devote yourself to things that bring you fulfilment and joy.</p>\n<p>And while we understand that you may find prioritising your own care over that of your foster child’s challenging, it’s crucial you put yourself first once in a while too. Your passions, hobbies and other healthy habits like socialising with new people, eating healthy and exercising in any way all need time and attention as well.</p>\n<p>After all, children are very intuitive, and so a foster child may pick up on your behaviours as an unhappy and burnout foster carer and feel the effects second-hand.</p>\n<h3>5. Poor sleeping habits</h3>\n<p>The unfortunate thing about burnout is that once you start to experience it, it becomes a vicious cycle. The more stressed you feel, the more difficult it becomes to put your thoughts to bed while you lay on your own and try to get some much-needed shut-eye. Here are some tips to ease your anxiety so you can sleep:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Regular exercise like running or walking</li>\n<li>Eating plenty of magnesium and zinc foods like spinach, swiss chard, nuts, oysters, eggs and beef</li>\n<li>Relaxing techniques like stretches and breathing exercises before bedtime</li>\n<li>Speaking to your GP, who could help you work through the causes and give you actionable steps and other options to help you</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>I think I have burnout, what should I do?</h2>\n<h3>Open communication with supporting professionals</h3>\n<p>Burnout is best resolved through good-quality emotional support from professionals like your social worker. Communicate openly with them, express what you have to say &#8211; your concerns, frustrations, and worries. Feelings of burnout need to be shared asap so that an alternative route of foster care can be provided before things reach crisis point.</p>\n<h3>Seek additional support</h3>\n<p>An extra workload could be contributing to increased stress levels. Consider seeking additional support via respite care, who can take over the care for a short time, while you take some time out for yourself.</p>\n<h3>Prioritise rest and recovery</h3>\n<p>A lack of sleep can raise cortisol (a hormone stimulated by stress) levels in your body. By prioritising rest and recovery, cortisol levels decrease as your body recovers from the effects of stress.</p>\n<h3>Develop coping skills</h3>\n<p>Coping skills like taking deep breaths, stretching, meditating, regular exercise and cooking healthy meals will help you to cope when feeling stressed and burned out.</p>\n<h3>Seek further professional help</h3>\n<p>Especially if there are additional causes of burnout, seeking further professional help is one of the most important steps you can take to manage your condition. Talking with a trained medical professional will help you find ways to deal with stress and may help you identify the root causes so you can address them.</p>\n<h2>How can we help?</h2>\n<p>Foster carers experiencing burnout or stress not only impacts their own well-being, but those who they care for too, especially if they’re caring for a traumatised child.

As a role model in their lives, you allow them to experience life as they should. It goes without saying that as a foster parent, you have a duty of care, and part of this responsibility is understanding confidentiality, and why it’s important in fostering.</p>\n<h2>What is the purpose of confidentiality?</h2>\n<p>The purpose of confidentiality is to preserve an individual’s dignity. For foster children who have experienced adverse life experiences like abuse, neglect and trauma, confidentiality is key for a stable environment.</p>\n<h2>The reasons for confidentiality</h2>\n<h3>1. It builds trust</h3>\n<p>If you fail to maintain confidentiality, it can trigger feelings of disrespect, insecurity and lack of trust. This is an issue because trust is synonymous with safety. A deep feeling of trust supports a child’s self-esteem and grows their confidence too &#8211; vital traits that are strongly linked to success in education, relationships and career.</p>\n<p>A lack of trust can have a domino effect on your foster child. Here are some of the impacts a breakdown in trust can have:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Development of an insecure attachment style like avoidant attachment</li>\n<li>Poor self-worth</li>\n<li>Inability or impaired ability to form relationships</li>\n<li>Social anxiety and withdrawal</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>2. Exposing confidential information can lead to trauma</h3>\n<p>For foster children in particular, they have often undergone traumatic experiences, leading them to foster care. Exposing confidential information compounds further trauma, impacting a foster child’s well-being as a whole. Cyberbullying and exploitation are just some of the experiences a foster child can undergo if their privacy or their personal information is leaked.</p>\n<p>On a social level, mental health disorders like anxiety and depression can arise if they experience bullying, ridicule or embarrassment after their confidential matters have been exposed.</p>\n<h3>3. Maintains healthy relationships and provides stability</h3>\n<p>By demonstrating that you can keep the information confidential, it demonstrates reliability, building the foundation for a healthy and stable foster family relationship. Reliability is an important trait in parenting, making you more likeable, valuable, dependable and responsible too.</p>\n<h3>4. A breach of confidentiality will put you at risk of de-registration</h3>\n<p>Any breach of confidentiality will be treated as a serious matter, and the likely outcome is that you will risk losing your fostering licence. Other consequences include financial losses, legal repercussions and damage to your reputation.</p>\n<h2>How to remain confidential</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Refrain from discussing your foster child’s circumstances and history with any individuals outside your foster family</li>\n<li>Any verbal communication of confidential information should be done in private, where it cannot be overheard by unauthorised individuals</li>\n<li>Any information on the child’s circumstances or history should be kept in a secure and private place like a lockable cabinet</li>\n<li>Any new information that your foster child discloses, refer to your <a href=\"https://www.nfa.co.uk/thinking-about-fostering/support-and-benefits-for-foster-carers/support/\">supervising social worker</a> first, as there may be Child Protection implications</li>\n<li>Before your foster child shares information, ensure you openly communicate with them that the information that they share, may need to be shared with their Social Worker too</li>\n<li>Establish with your foster child the repercussions of sharing photos and other information about their circumstances, as well as other foster children’s, on social media or anywhere else</li>\n<li>Provide your foster children with information about the reasons for fostering and confidentiality principles, with guidance from your Supervising Social Worker</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Can you make a difference?</h3>\n<p>Around the country, dozens of children enter the care system every day &#8211; children who can’t live at home through no fault of their own.

      "content": "<p>You probably already know that fostering is a fulfilling and rewarding experience. However, when you welcome your foster child into your home for the first time, it’s understandable to feel a little anxious. With that said, your foster child will be feeling nervous too, so it’s vital that you make an impression that enables them to relax, and feel comfortable.</p>\n<p>To help you along with this, we’ve come up with some tips you can follow that will help your foster child feel right at home.</p>\n<h3>Know their background</h3>\n<p>Part of making your foster child feel at home is learning about them before they arrive. Of course, a lot of information will be confidential, and you won’t get an insight unless the child themselves tells you.</p>\n<p>However, knowing what you can will help your foster child feel safe and welcome as you understand their preferences. These can include their preferred name, hobbies and interests, and other personal likings, such as favourite music and food.</p>\n<h3>Communicate openly with your foster child</h3>\n<p>We often hear about the power of communication. It’s true that honest and open communication is crucial to forming a healthy relationship. One that is founded on understanding and connection helps to curate a bond like no other, which is vital when it comes to fostering.</p>\n<p>When your foster child arrives, it&#8217;s crucial to communicate openly and effectively. Share who you are, what you value and your passions—share what makes you tick. This makes you relatable and helps them feel comfortable with you as they realise you’re a person with vulnerabilities too. Assure them that you are there to support them, and that they can trust you and come to you with any problems they’re facing.</p>\n<h3>Create bonding opportunities</h3>\n<p>By producing opportunities where you and your foster child can bond, you create the conditions for a positive parent-child relationship to form. As they get more comfortable with you, and your connection grows, they start to feel more comfortable around you. Here are some activities you and your foster child can bond over:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Redecorating the house, like painting a room together. You could even let them pick out a colour or give them the freedom to decorate and paint their own bedroom or private area however they please.</li>\n<li>Spend some time in the garden and interact with nature. You could even plant a tree together that could serve as a memento and a symbol of your time together that they can visit in years to come.</li>\n<li>Cooking a meal together that can be served to the whole family.</li>\n<li>Get to know their interests and hobbies and participate in them.</li>\n<li>Go outdoors and exercise together, like taking a hike in nature or having a kickabout at the beach.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Give your foster child their own space</h3>\n<p>You’ll need to create a personalised and comfortable space for them with the essentials: a bed, dresser/wardrobe and furnishings. It’s important to make it feel homely, but even better if you are able to tell them that they can add their own personal touches to make it feel more like home to them. You can make a project out of it, taking them shopping for room accessories or allowing them to paint the room their favourite colour, to make it feel more comforting to them. This is also a great way to bond and you can start to get to know your foster child and learn what they like and dislike.</p>\n<p>It’s normal for children and young people to want to <a href=\"https://www.nfa.co.uk/thinking-about-fostering/spare-rooms-and-fostering/\">have their own space</a> where they can have some alone time. When they have time to themselves, they have the freedom to understand who they are and what they’re about &#8211; so ensure you are giving them time to themselves too.</p>\n<p>A room that they can call their own gives your foster child some privacy and also <a href=\"https://www.nfa.co.uk/news-and-blog/how-we-prepare-older-foster-children-for-independent-living/\">teaches them independence</a>. It can positively impact their mental and physical health, and instil confidence as they learn to handle things and work through their own limitations independently, in a space that they’re comfortable in.</p>\n<h3>Have a daily routine</h3>\n<p>Create a daily routine that includes wake-up and bedtimes, as well as set times for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and designated times for daily activities. <a href=\"https://www.nfa.co.uk/news-and-blog/10-ways-to-help-young-people-adjust-to-the-school-routine/\">Having a routine is essential</a> because it provides children with a sense of security and control over their surroundings. Many foster children may not have experienced this stability, or they might have struggled with it, so a well-organised and consistent home life can significantly help them feel safe, secure, and cared for, particularly during stressful periods.</p>\n<h2>Can you make a difference?</h2>\n<p>Around the country, dozens of children enter the care system every day &#8211; children who can’t live at home through no fault of their own.

Denise shared, “Team swim! are fantastic. I had a very frightened little boy who has struggled with water in all its forms for a long time, but the staff went above and beyond to put him at ease and show him the fun he can have in the water. This was a huge turning point for him, I’m now taking him swimming twice a week and his confidence continues to grow.”</p>\n<p>Isn&#8217;t that just heartwarming? And it gets even better!

      "content": "<p>By taking on a foster child, you provide them with a stable and supportive environment so they have the best childhood possible that sets them up for success. Not only do you give benefits to those in your care, but also if you have children of your own. The benefits of foster care can be plentiful to your immediate family.</p>\n<h2>How your children benefit from foster care</h2>\n<h3>They will develop caring skills of their own</h3>\n<p>Particularly at young ages, children are incredibly perceptive and their brains are like sponges, soaking up information much more quickly than adults. Witnessing for themselves your fostering practices will help your birth children understand the skills required when caring for your foster child.</p>\n<p>Practising positive parenting with your foster children gives your birth children an opportunity to see and understand proper caregiving and empathy. Witnessing this at a young age is more likely to make an impression so that they may repeat these responsible behaviours in their own lives.</p>\n<h3>They will become more understanding</h3>\n<p>Many children are born into families where they have the proper support and care that a parent should provide. However, foster children have often not been given the privilege of a tight-knit family that is stable and healthy. This is why foster carers are so important.</p>\n<p>Not only do foster carers give foster children the requirements parents should provide, they also highlight why they are there in the first place. By giving some understanding of their situation to your own children, it gives them a unique perspective on how some children, and people in general, are less fortunate. In turn, they become more grateful for their own circumstances and environment, and more generous and empathetic as they grow up.</p>\n<h3>They will gain a sibling-like relationship</h3>\n<p>Although not strictly a sibling, the relationship between your current children and your foster child can be similar to a sibling relationship. The benefits of having siblings can help your foster child grow into a more rounded individual, as well as having benefits for your birth children too:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sibling relationships promote empathy, a trait that is valuable with foster children.</li>\n<li>Achievements in both academia and sports are promoted when a child has a sibling.</li>\n<li>Sibling relationships can be a source of support for your child.</li>\n<li>It can teach key skills such as sharing, patience and sociability.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Even though sibling relationships are healthy for a child’s well-being for the reasons mentioned above, there’s one that rides above them all. When fostered correctly, having a sibling means having a friend for life, offering companionship through life’s journey and all the benefits that come with it like personal development and reducing stress.</p>\n<h2>What to be aware of when fostering with birth children</h2>\n<p>Fostering with birth children can have its challenges too. Being aware of what these are, it will help you avoid them in the future and establish a healthy foster and birth child relationship.</p>\n<h3>Mimicking or copying behaviour</h3>\n<p>Foster children can display challenging behaviour, due to the nature of their traumatic and unsettling experiences, particularly with adults. Witnessing inappropriate behaviour from the foster child may mean that your children copy or mimic the behaviour, thinking it’s acceptable.</p>\n<h3>Difficulty sharing</h3>\n<p>Particularly if your children aren’t used to having other children around regularly like they would be if they had a brother or sister, your children might find it difficult to share with your foster child. However, once they understand the need for sharing, especially with foster children, this can be enough to get them to become more comfortable with sharing their belongings, time and space.</p>\n<h3>Some grievance when the placement ends</h3>\n<p>One of the great things about having a foster child while also having children of your own, is it gives each of them companionship. When the foster child leaves your care, this can trigger a sense of loss in your children and cause them to grieve. Although it can be disruptive, this can be managed if you explain the fostering process to your birth child/ren and encourage them to keep in contact with your foster child once they leave your care.</p>\n<h2>We’re always on hand to help</h2>\n<p>We understand that bringing a foster child into your home has the potential to change the dynamic your birth children are used to.

      "content": "<p>Holidays are an important part of a foster child’s childhood. A holiday can give them a valuable life experience like exposing them to culture, history and education &#8211; it helps them become more well-rounded individuals.</p>\n<p>Taking your foster child on holiday can also be beneficial for you, the carer, too. Accompanying you as you make valuable memories and cherished experiences, it makes the transition from home to holiday worthwhile. In fact, there are several benefits to everyone involved by taking your foster children with you on holiday.</p>\n<h2>The many benefits of a holiday for your foster child</h2>\n<p>Taking time away from your home, whether that be abroad or even staying elsewhere right here in the UK, can be a worthwhile experience for them no matter where you go.</p>\n<h3>Can help support rehabilitation for mental health problems</h3>\n<p>It’s no secret that foster children are more likely to suffer from and experience mental health problems like depression and anxiety disorders. While not a cure for such mental health problems, trips away from home can help your foster child reach rehabilitation goals that include overcoming these issues.</p>\n<h3>Foster children are more likely to interact with new people</h3>\n<p>A holiday helps foster children meet people outside of their usual social circle, which includes their foster parents and peers. The benefits of social interaction with new people are numerous:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They are better able to manage depression, anxiety and stress</li>\n<li>It builds a shared positive experience and the opportunity for a continued connection, which helps to build trust &#8211; a factor that is directly linked to subjective well-being</li>\n<li>It helps them to experience new perspectives</li>\n<li>It contributes to improving social skills and social intelligence</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>They get to experience other cultures firsthand</h3>\n<p>It’s one thing learning about other cultures in the classroom, at home or even in books, but it’s an entirely new experience letting foster children experience cultures on their own.</p>\n<p>A holiday abroad exposes foster children to this prospect, helping them to appreciate what they may already have as well as helping them develop a better understanding of the world outside the home.</p>\n<h3>Better physical health</h3>\n<p>A holiday can improve a foster child’s physical health. Not only can a holiday contribute to a decrease in stress levels, a significant factor of increased risks of heart disease and high blood pressure, but it can also improve a foster child’s overall health by encouraging them to go exploring.</p>\n<p>Encouraging the child to get involved in holiday activities such as swimming, volleyball, children’s clubs, beach football etc, is also a great way to ensure they’re getting daily exercise in fun, new ways &#8211; maybe even encouraging them to find a new hobby they can continue once they go back home.</p>\n<h3>Increased productivity</h3>\n<p>A well-needed break from the every day can mean your foster child will feel refreshed when they go back to school or college. Not to mention, children who are given the opportunity to take time out to relax are less likely to experience burnout, which can inhibit creativity and make them less productive in general.</p>\n<h2>A chance for you and your foster child to bond</h2>\n<p>From increasing trust, to creating memories together that you can both reminisce about later, taking a holiday with your foster child is good for your relationship overall.</p>\n<p>Travelling away together, creates shared moments that ultimately bring you and your foster child together. Whether that be exploring new places, tasting new food or taking part in new activities, the importance of these experiences don’t just unfold in the moment, they last a lifetime too. Especially for those children who have never had the chance to experience a holiday before with their birth or previous foster families.</p>\n<h2>How can you take a foster child on holiday abroad?</h2>\n<p>We have a full page on <a href=\"https://www.nfa.co.uk/news-and-blog/6-things-you-should-know-about-taking-foster-children-on-holiday/\">all the things you should know about taking your foster child on holiday</a>. However, whether you’re at the holiday planning stage, or are just curious, here’s the general gist of what you need to know:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Holiday permission: rules and regulations</strong> &#8211; Have a read of the Government’s Fostering Services: National Minimum Standards. It states that when the child’s individual circumstances are taken into account, their welfare and safety considered paramount, then your foster children are likely able to go on holiday</li>\n<li><strong>Staying in the UK or going abroad</strong> &#8211; Foster children can still get plenty of the benefits from a holiday by staying in the UK. With that said, so long as you have the necessary paperwork and permissions, going abroad is still a viable option</li>\n<li><strong>Accommodation</strong> &#8211; Make sure you speak to your Supervising Social Worker before you book. They will be able to advise you on how best to choose a place to stay that is appropriate for everyone</li>\n<li><strong>Keeping safe</strong> &#8211; With some careful planning and consideration of suitable activities, you can keep your foster child safe while also ensuring they are having a fun experience</li>\n<li><strong>Holiday alternatives</strong> &#8211; You can still make sure your foster child has lots of fun by planning day trips instead of a holiday. You may also want to take a break yourself and try <a href=\"https://www.nfa.co.uk/thinking-about-fostering/types-of-foster-care/respite-foster-care/\">respite foster care</a> to allow yourself to recharge your batteries</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Do foster parents get paid holidays?</h2>\n<p>Many fostering agencies increase the foster care allowance over the school holidays. However, check with your agency or local authority before you go as you may be entitled to additional payment too.</p>\n<h3>Can you make a difference?</h3>\n<p>Around the country, dozens of children enter the care system every day &#8211; children who can’t live<span id=\"more-8299\"></span><!--more--> at home through no fault of their own. We work with local authorities in every region of the UK to meet the growing demand for all types of fostering. Can you <a href=\"https://www.nfa.co.uk/thinking-about-fostering/becoming-a-foster-carer/\">become a foster carer</a> and make a difference to a child’s future?</p>\n<p>We offer a generous <a href=\"https://www.nfa.co.uk/thinking-about-fostering/support-and-benefits-for-foster-carers/financial-support/\">fostering allowance</a>, with exclusive perks and benefits, free training (including specialisms) and exceptional <a href=\"https://www.nfa.co.uk/thinking-about-fostering/support-and-benefits-for-foster-carers/support/\">fostering support</a> from your local team of fostering professionals.</p>\n<p>If you’re unsure whether you’re eligible, try our Can I Foster? tool, which answers common questions about suitability to foster, based on a personalised Q and A style format.

Therefore, we never discriminate based on race, gender, relationship status or age. The main priority is finding foster carers who are able to provide a secure, stable and loving home.</p>\n<p>With that in mind, there are some things we need to consider when it comes to carers with religious beliefs. Whilst we welcome and accept applications from all religions, the number one concern is whether the child placed within the home will be accepted if their beliefs differ from the foster parents.</p>\n<h2><strong>A focus on placements</strong></h2>\n<p>We will always strive to match placements as closely as possible. This means also matching religious beliefs. We strongly believe that a child who comes from a religious background would benefit greatly from being placed into a foster home that practices the same beliefs.</p>\n<p>Religion can present several issues which require specialist knowledge. For example, some religions don’t believe in certain holidays such as Christmas, or they have certain dietary requirements which need to be met. Therefore, matching placements in accordance with religion is in the best interest of both the child and the carer.</p>\n<div class=\"c-cta-bar c-cta-bar--default c-cta-bar--background-pink\"><div class=\"c-cta-bar__caption\">Start your fostering journey today</div><div class=\"c-cta-bar__link\"><a href=\"/thinking-about-fostering/can-i-foster/\" class=\"nfa-button nfa-button--orange nfa-button--right-arrow\" target=\"\">Can I foster?</a></div></div>\n<p>However, it isn’t always possible to place foster children into a home which follows the same religion. In this instance we do provide full <a href=\"https://www.nfa.co.uk/thinking-about-fostering/support-and-benefits-for-foster-carers/training/\">foster care training</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nfa.co.uk/thinking-about-fostering/support-and-benefits-for-foster-carers/support/\">fostering support</a> to help our carers understand the needs of the child in their care. What really matters, is that the beliefs of the child accepted and are not compromised or belittled in any way.</p>\n<h2><strong>Dealing with conflicting beliefs</strong></h2>\n<p>If you are taking on a child who has different beliefs to your own, it’s helpful to have as much communication with both your social worker and the child’s biological family as you possibly can. They will be able to tell you everything you need to know about the child’s religious beliefs and provide advice on how to cater to them.</p>\n<p>Of course, it isn’t always possible to chat to the biological parents. If the child is old enough, you can talk to them and ask them how you can help them to continue with their faith. Do they need anything from you, such as to take them to church or provide specialist meals?</p>\n<p>The main thing you need to remember when your beliefs clash with a foster child’s is that they have a right to choose their own religion. Or, if they are younger, their biological parents have the right to decide for them. You may not agree, but accepting your beliefs are different and accommodating for that is key to maintaining a good foster relationship.</p>\n<p>All of our foster parents have a say in which placements they receive. Therefore, if conflicting religious beliefs are likely to cause a problem, you should let us know. It is vital that a child is able to feel safe and accepted in their placement.</p>\n<p>Overall, regardless of which religion you practice, you will be welcome as one of our valued carers. As long as the child’s needs are put first and you’re willing to accept they may have different beliefs to you, your religion will not deter you from fostering and we’d be delighted to hear from you if you’re interested in getting started.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nfa.co.uk/news-and-blog/religion-and-foster-care-at-nfg/\">Religion and Foster Care</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.nfa.co.uk\">National Fostering Group</a>.</p>",

On 26th October, she joined our Chief Executive, Steve Christie, on a ‘radio takeover’.</p>\n<p>Their message was clear: there aren’t nearly enough foster carers – and that this shortfall might be partly because people assume they’re not suitable due to their age, relationship status, career, or disability, among other things.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>People assume they’re not suitable due to their age, relationship status, career, or disability… Nothing could be further from the truth.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Nothing could be further from the truth – take it from us:  as the largest independent fostering agency in the UK, our 3,000 foster carers are a truly diverse group of people.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Our youngest foster carers are in their mid-20s and our oldest is in her 80s.</li>\n<li>We have single, married, divorced and blended family and LGBTQ+ foster carers.</li>\n<li>Some of our foster carers work outside the home, part time or full time.</li>\n<li>A number of our foster carers have a long-term condition or disability.</li>\n<li>Some have children of their own, of all ages; others do not.</li>\n<li>Dogs and cats are common in fostering families, along with more exotic pets too.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Councils’ data (responding to our Freedom of Information request) shows that 60% had experienced a surge in young people going into care in the last 12 months &#8211; children who can’t live at home through no fault of their own. Tragically, there are simply not enough foster carers available to take them in, with some areas of the country facing a chronic shortage.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>“Foster carers … have a unique chance to make a real difference to a child&#8217;s life”</strong></p>\n<p><strong>– Fatima Whitbread</strong></p></blockquote>\n<h2>Our campaign</h2>\n<p>The original plan was that Steve and Fatima – individually and together – would spend dawn to dusk giving interviews to local and national radio stations.</p>\n<p>In fact, the story jumped to TV very quickly, and to online and print news and social channels too.

Nobody will ever be turned away based on their religious beliefs, sexuality, ethnicity, gender, or age.</p>\n<p>You also don’t have to be experienced to apply to foster. All we ask is that you’re passionate about making a difference in the lives of these children as we can offer all the training and support you need.</p>\n<p>Plus, you’ll be surrounded by foster parents with all different levels of experience, so you can soak up the knowledge of those who have 10 or 20 years of fostering under their belt, while feeling safe in the knowledge that others are also new to fostering, just like you.</p>\n<p>So really the main initial requirements for <a title=\"About fostering\" href=\"/about-fostering/\">fostering a child</a> are that you have a spare room that is permanently available to a child in your care, that you have the right to work and live in the UK, that you are aged 21 years or older, and that you have a whole load of love and stability to give to a child in care.</p>\n\n                                                    </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                        <div class=\"accordion-item\">\n                    <div class=\"title\">\n                        <p>Why are more foster parents needed?</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"content-wrapper\">\n                        <div class=\"content\">\n                            <p>There is a rising number of children coming into foster care each year, and not enough foster families are able to welcome these children into their homes in their hour of need.</p>\n<p>As well as children being referred to residential homes, when a family home environment in foster care would have better suited their needs, we&#8217;re also seeing siblings being separated and children being moved further away from their local communities than necessary. All these scenarios can adversely affect a child’s wellbeing, their sense of identity, and ultimately, their outcomes in care.</p>\n<p><span class=\"sub-heading\">Siblings being separated </span></p>\n<p>As far as is practically possible, and in the best interests of each child, <a title=\"Thinking of Fostering Siblings\" href=\"/thinking-about-fostering/thinking-of-fostering-siblings/\">siblings should be placed in the same foster home</a>. This ensures a smooth transition to foster care. Older siblings will tend to take care of younger ones, thus increasing their level of trust and comfort. The family unit is, therefore, not entirely disrupted and the kids tend to adapt faster than single foster children.</p>\n<p><span class=\"sub-heading\"><strong>Children being moved far away</strong> </span></p>\n<p>Children should ideally be placed within their local communities. This allows them to retain their existing friendships and peer support groups. As they do not have to change schools, their education will not be disrupted, and apart from their new home, life will continue as before. This is the least stressful option.</p>\n<p>However, the shortage of foster parents often results in children being placed in a home far from their community. This adds to the unfamiliar surroundings they are expected to acclimatise to. These children feel very isolated and struggle to make new friends. If the school year has already commenced, other children would already have formed their social groups and chosen their best friends. It becomes next to impossible for the child in this situation to develop a close friendship or find inclusion in a group.</p>\n<p>Interaction is a key skill that is learned at school, and because of their difficult circumstances, children in care may miss out on acquiring this competency. Their school work may be affected, and they could become more withdrawn at home.</p>\n\n                                                    </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                        <div class=\"accordion-item\">\n                    <div class=\"title\">\n                        <p>How are prospective foster parents assessed?</p>\n                    </div>\n                    <div class=\"content-wrapper\">\n                        <div class=\"content\">\n                            <p>It generally takes around 4-6 months to <a title=\"How to become a foster parent\" href=\"/about-fostering/how-to-become-a-foster-parent/\">become a foster parent</a>.

Ofsted highlighted our commitment to education and meeting cultural needs which I’m particularly proud of.”</p>\n<p>We provide emergency, short-term, long-term, and parent-and-child placements for children up to the age of 18, and also support young adults who have moved onto independence, but wish to remain with their foster parents.</p>\n<p>There are expected to be more than 100,000 children in care by 2025 which means there is a growing need for more foster parents throughout the UK. Our Southern Counties team supports children across <a title=\"South London\" href=\"/locations/south-london/\">South London</a>, <a title=\"Essex\" href=\"/locations/essex/\">Essex</a>, and all across the <a title=\"West Sussex\" href=\"/offices/west-sussex/\">South of England</a>.</p>\n<p>We provide around-the-clock local support to all of our foster parents with a 24/7 helpline, so there is always someone on hand to help and advise when supporting their children and young people.
