It is a clear indication that children and young people experience the highest quality care and support possible, enabling them to achieve their goals and ambitions that they may not have been able to. It reflects consistently excellent practice, robust safeguarding, and exceptional leadership across every part of our agency.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">For the Children and Young People in Our Care</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For children, this means they feel safe, valued, and genuinely heard by our foster carers and staff. They are supported to grow in confidence, achieve their goals, and experience the stability and encouragement they need to thrive. It shows that their voices matter and that their wellbeing is at the heart of everything we do.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">For Our Foster Carers</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For foster carers, this recognition reflects the high-quality training, guidance and round-the-clock support they receive, as well as the positive, lasting difference they make to the lives of the children in their care. Swiis foster carers are among the best in the sector, consistently providing nurturing, stable homes where children and young people feel safe, valued and able to thrive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Swiis foster carers know they are never alone. They are part of a supportive community, backed by a dedicated team who are always there, listening, guiding and standing alongside them, fully committed to their success and to the wellbeing and future of every child and young person in their care.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">As a Fostering Agency</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Ofsted only awards ‘Outstanding’ when a fostering agency consistently goes above and beyond for their foster carers and the children within their care. Having consistently ‘Outstanding’ ratings in all areas across our Midlands and South, North East, Yorkshire and North West offices is an exceptionally proud achievement for all Swiis staff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This accomplishment reflects the dedication, compassion and professionalism of every member of the Swiis team. It is a testament to the hard work our staff put in every day and to our unwavering commitment to achieving the best possible outcomes for children and young people.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Highlights From Our Ofsted Reports</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Across the Midlands and South, North East, Yorkshire and North West, children receive nurturing, individualised care that helps them make exceptional progress.

Swiis places strong emphasis on children’s engagement with education, ensuring their commitment and participation are actively supported. Every achievement, big or small, is recognised and celebrated by our teams, helping children build confidence and feel empowered to aspire to and reach their goals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“Specialist and bespoke support is provided by a dedicated team that works alongside children to break down any barriers to their learning.”</em> &#8211; Midlands and South Ofsted Report</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“Children’s education and learning progress are at the forefront of the agency’s practice.”</em> &#8211; North East Ofsted Report</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Swiis <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/fostering/support/\">Education Advisors</a> work closely with children and foster carers to understand each child’s unique learning needs and provide tailored guidance to overcome challenges. By prioritising education, Swiis ensures that every child and young person has the best possible opportunity to succeed, develop confidence, and achieve their full potential, while foster carers feel fully supported in helping children reach their goals.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Our Dedicated Stability and Support Team</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Swiis’s Stability &amp; Support Team provides foster carers with an additional layer of personalised guidance and one-to-one support, helping them respond confidently to any concerns or behaviours a child or young person may present. From the very beginning of their fostering journey, carers can access practical advice and proven strategies to support them through any challenging moments.&nbsp; The Stability and Support Team can be accessed directly by the foster carer if preferred and is in addition to the exceptional daily support of the social work teams.&nbsp; This wrap around support ensures foster carers are well equipped to create safe, nurturing environments where children can thrive, grow and overcome barriers they may face.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“Foster carers feel exceptionally well supported and valued by agency staff, which impacts positively on the outcomes of children who are thriving in their foster families.”</em> &#8211; North West Ofsted Report</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Exceptional Safeguarding</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Safeguarding is at the heart of everything we do at Swiis. Children and young people feel safe, supported and valued in our foster homes, cared for by experienced foster carers and supported by highly skilled and committed social work teams. We operate robust and comprehensive safeguarding processes to ensure the highest standards of safety and wellbeing for every child in our care.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Safeguarding is also central to our recruitment, assessment and approval processes. All foster carers and Swiis staff go through rigorous checks and preparation, ensuring they are well trained, confident and fully supported in their role. This strong safeguarding framework promotes stability and enables foster carers to provide safe, nurturing homes where children can thrive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“Safeguarding children is at the centre of the agency.”</em> &#8211; Midlands and South Ofsted Report</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Swiis, every decision and action prioritises the safety and well-being of children. This gives foster carers confidence that they are fully supported when protecting children, knowing they are not alone in ensuring the highest standards of care. Children, in turn, feel secure, protected, and able to build trust with the foster carers caring for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Comprehensive and Relevant Training</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Swiis provides foster carers with comprehensive and practical <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/fostering/training/\">training</a>, giving them the knowledge and confidence they need to meet children’s diverse needs. Well-trained foster carers can respond effectively to both every day and complex situations, helping children feel secure, supported, and understood at all times.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“Highly effective post-approval training ensures that foster carers have the relevant skills and knowledge to undertake the fostering role.”</em> &#8211; North West Ofsted Report</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Child-Focused Leadership and Staff</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Swiis is led by experienced leaders who provide strong oversight and inspire continuous improvement. Staff morale is high, workloads are manageable, and teams work closely together to deliver consistent, high-quality care. All regions have strong partnerships with other professionals to ensure children remain at the centre of all practice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“Foster carers have provided overwhelmingly positive feedback about the support they receive from the agency.”</em> &#8211; Midlands and South Ofsted Report</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Foster carers consistently report feeling valued, supported, and heard. This strengthens fostering home-finding arrangements, enabling children to thrive in stable, nurturing homes where their emotional and developmental needs are met.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“Staff morale is high, and staff say that they love their job.”</em> &#8211; North East Ofsted Report</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Motivated and passionate staff ensure children receive consistent, high-quality care. When staff feel proud and inspired by their work, it directly benefits foster carers and children, creating a supportive environment where everyone can flourish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“Social workers have manageable caseloads and are in weekly contact with their foster carers.”</em> &#8211; North West Ofsted Report</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regular, meaningful contact allows social workers to provide timely guidance, reassurance, and practical support. This ensures foster carers are equipped to meet children’s needs effectively, helping children feel safe, cared for, and supported at every stage of their fostering journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-kadence-image kb-image27548_bc74df-1d size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Ofsted-Blog-North-West-Team.jpg\" alt=\"North West Team\" class=\"kb-img wp-image-27550\" srcset=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Ofsted-Blog-North-West-Team.jpg 1920w, https://www.swiisfostercare.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Ofsted-Blog-North-West-Team-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.swiisfostercare.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Ofsted-Blog-North-West-Team-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>A Huge Thank You!</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We would like to extend our heartfelt thanks to our foster carers, the children, and young people in our care, and every member of the Swiis team.

This achievement means that all Swiis regions, including Yorkshire, the North East, the North West, the Midlands and South, are officially rated Outstanding, the highest possible recognition across all areas of our service.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These inspections were embraced by every team member as an opportunity to showcase the exceptional work we do together. An Ofsted Outstanding rating is more than an accolade, it is recognition that children are not only safe but flourishing, supported by stable arrangements, highly skilled foster carers, and leadership that is relentless in its pursuit of excellence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An outstanding award also reflects the fact that our foster carers are exceptionally well trained and supported, with robust safeguarding, strong professional relationships, and a culture of continuous improvement that truly puts children first.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"kb-row-layout-wrap kb-row-layout-id27522_736d13-8b aligncenter wp-block-kadence-rowlayout\"><div class=\"kt-row-column-wrap kt-has-2-columns kt-row-layout-right-golden kt-tab-layout-right-golden kt-mobile-layout-row kt-row-valign-middle\">\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-kadence-column kadence-column27522_f7cf38-f4 kb-section-dir-vertical inner-column-2\"><div class=\"kt-inside-inner-col\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-kadence-image kb-image27522_0cb01e-bc\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"638\" height=\"639\" src=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Ofsted_Outstanding.png\" alt=\"Ofsted - Outstanding provider\" class=\"kb-img wp-image-23878\" srcset=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Ofsted_Outstanding.png 638w, https://www.swiisfostercare.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Ofsted_Outstanding-150x150.png 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 638px) 100vw, 638px\" /></figure></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-kadence-column kadence-column27522_190dd3-00 kb-section-dir-vertical inner-column-1\"><div class=\"kt-inside-inner-col\">\n<p class=\"has--font-size\"><em>&#8220;The independent fostering agency provides highly effective services that consistently exceed the standards of good.

Across Swiis Foster Care, children have experienced increased stability, improved emotional well-being, and the confidence that comes from feeling safe, valued, and listened to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of our children have made significant personal progress, overcoming early trauma with the help of consistent, nurturing foster arrangements. These achievements, whether it’s improved school attendance, renewed self-belief, learning new skills or simply learning to trust again, are powerful reminders of the impact that exceptional foster care can have on a child’s life.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Foster Carers: The Beating Heart of Swiis Foster Care</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2025, Swiis Foster Care truly demonstrated that we are the agency of choice.

Their role is to work directly with foster carers, offering tailored advice, practical strategies, and specialist guidance around behaviours and complex needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2025, this team had its busiest year yet. Demand grew as carers increasingly accessed this invaluable support, a clear testament to how impactful and trusted the service has become. In response, we expanded the team to ensure every foster carer receives timely, expert help when they need it most.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team also introduced specialist forum groups and topical webinar training, with subjects chosen by our foster carers themselves. This collaborative approach has empowered carers, strengthened peer connections, and further enhanced the quality of care provided to children.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-kadence-advancedbtn kb-buttons-wrap kb-btns27522_43a9fb-e5\"><a class=\"kb-button kt-button button kb-btn27522_dcaf50-18 kt-btn-size-standard kt-btn-width-type-auto kb-btn-global-fill  kt-btn-has-text-true kt-btn-has-svg-false  wp-block-kadence-singlebtn\" href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/fostering/support/stability-and-support-team/\"><span class=\"kt-btn-inner-text\">View The Stability &amp; Support Team</span></a></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Looking Ahead to 2026</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As we reflect on 2025, we do so with immense pride. This was a year of outstanding achievement, heartfelt dedication, and genuine transformation for children, foster carers, and staff alike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Together, we have shown what is possible when care, expertise, and passion come together. And as we look to the future, one thing remains certain: Swiis Foster Care will continue to go above and beyond, because every child deserves nothing less.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we move into 2026, our commitment remains unwavering. At Swiis Foster Care, we will continue to evolve and strengthen the support we provide to both our foster carers and the children and young people in their care. Everything we do is guided by one clear purpose: ensuring that every child can feel safe, nurtured, and supported to achieve their full potential.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those choosing to begin their fostering journey with Swiis, we are committed to making that experience as supportive, flexible, and stress-free as possible. From the very first conversation, through assessment, approval, and beyond, our focus is on supporting our carers every step of the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the next few months, we will be sharing more about the wonderful achievements of our children, celebrating their progress, resilience, and successes. We will also be highlighting the vital role of our social work teams and our foster carers, alongside the specialist provision offered by our Stability and Support Team, giving greater insight into how this enhanced support continues to make a meaningful difference for carers and children alike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, we will be sharing more details about the feedback from our Ofsted Outstanding inspection outcomes, helping to demonstrate what outstanding practice looks like and how it directly benefits the children we support.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/swiis-foster-care-highlights-of-an-extraordinary-2025/\">Swiis Foster Care: Highlights of an Extraordinary 2025</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com\">Swiis Foster Care</a>.</p>",

She liked the idea of helping children who needed a safe, stable home but she just wasn’t sure when the right moment would be.</p>\n<p>“I’d always thought about fostering and thought it would be a nice thing to do,” she says. “A friend of mine started fostering and said, ‘Would you like me to give you my social worker’s number?’ And it all started from there.”</p>\n                            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"content-block-block_1635c5a6c49a12f2fa426fcf05c7e1a0\" class=\"custom-block content-block alignfull has-none-background-color theme-none spacing-top-half spacing-bottom-half width-full\" data-columns=\"1\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n\n                    <div class=\"content\">\n                <p><span class=\"text-medium\" style=\"color: #e5007e;\"><strong>Moments that make it all worthwhile</strong></span></p>\n<p>Over the years, Debbie has welcomed many children with different backgrounds and needs. One young person stands out.</p>\n<p>“We had a child come to live with us who was quite challenging at the time,” she explains. “He was from another country, and his culture was very different to ours. It was challenging for him and for us.”</p>\n<p>Debbie never expected him to stay in touch — but he did.</p>\n<p>“When he left, I didn’t think he would keep in touch, but he did and he still does to this day. Any problems he has, or difficulties, or even achievements, he’ll always come back and tell us, which is lovely.”</p>\n<p>Another moment that means a lot to Debbie involves a young person she cares for now.</p>\n<p>“When she came to live with us, she found it quite difficult — especially around men, including my husband,” Debbie says. “As time went on, she got more relaxed. The moment she just went up and gave him a hug… that was really, really nice. That was one of my favourite moments.”</p>\n<p><span class=\"text-medium\" style=\"color: #e5007e;\"><strong>The qualities that matter</strong></span></p>\n<p>Debbie believes empathy is the most important part of fostering.</p>\n<p>“You need to have that empathy for children because they come from all different backgrounds,” she says. “For somebody to just turn up at your home and have to live with another family &#8211; it’s really, really hard. I’d find it difficult, let alone a little child.”</p>\n            </div>\n        \n        \n            </div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div id=\"image-text-block_cdc824443fe16ef527f9d99c228e6e7b\" class=\"custom-block image-text-block alignfull image-right has-none-background-color theme-none spacing-top-none spacing-bottom-full width-full\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"content\">\n            <p><span class=\"text-medium\" style=\"color: #e5007e;\"><strong>Support that’s always there</strong></span></p>\n<p>For Debbie, FCA’s support has made a big difference to her fostering journey.</p>\n<p>“We receive lots of support from FCA, and it can be in different ways,” she explains. “If there’s something we’re finding difficult or challenging, we can always go and ask. If there’s something we’re not sure of, there&#8217;s always somebody on the end of the phone. Even if our social worker’s off, there’s always someone we can contact.”</p>\n<p><span class=\"text-medium\" style=\"color: #e5007e;\"><strong>Her advice?</strong></span></p>\n<p>After 15 years, Debbie still loves fostering &#8211; and she encourages others to explore it too.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“If you’re thinking about fostering, it’s worth finding out more. You don’t have to know everything, you just need to care. The rest comes with support.”</p></blockquote>\n                    </div>\n\n                    <div class=\"media\">\n                <img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"625\"

Hosted by Faye, the podcast brings together real voices from across the <a href=\"https://www.polariscommunity.co.uk/\">Polaris Community</a>, including care-experienced people, foster parents, those who grew up in fostering households, and fostering professionals. Together, they talk openly and honestly about what fostering is really like – the ups, the challenges, and everything in between.</p>\n<p>In the first three episodes, you’ll hear from Jo August, our CEO, who grew up in a fostering family and brings over 35 years’ experience in the sector; Alison and Theresa, foster parents, sharing their personal journeys; and Jim McGarrigle, Responsible Individual across a number of our fostering services.</p>\n<p>All offering insight from years of professional experience. Together, they explore fostering from every angle, grounded in real life, not theory.</p>\n<p>The podcast is full of honest stories from foster parents, myth-busting conversations about fostering, practical tips, and insights from the journey. You’ll also hear from care-experienced staff, people who grew up in fostering, and long-time foster carers. It’s perfect for anyone who is curious about fostering, unsure if it’s right for them, or looking for reassurance from people who’ve been there.</p>\n<p>It’s a space to listen, learn, and reflect, hearing real experiences that can help you decide what fostering might look like for you.</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"emoji\" role=\"img\" draggable=\"false\"

So, I looked into fostering, got some information, found out about it… had lots of appointments, found out loads of details, and then decided to give it a go.”</p>\n                            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"content-block-block_495f5d7b0336fa434f1f5b1595062a73\" class=\"custom-block content-block alignfull has-none-background-color theme-none spacing-top-half spacing-bottom-none width-full\" data-columns=\"1\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n\n                    <div class=\"content\">\n                <p><span class=\"text-medium text-small-medium\" style=\"color: #1d57a5;\"><strong>Tracy’s introduction to fostering </strong></span></p>\n<p>Tracy’s first three years as a foster parent were with her local authority in Shropshire. But after relocating to the North West, she felt ready for a fresh start.</p>\n<p>“On our relocation, I got in touch with a foster carer who recommended FCA,” she explains. “So I got in touch with the agency. Somebody came round, we had a chat, and we went through the process again and joined <a href=\"https://www.thefca.co.uk/regions/north-west/\">FCA North West</a>.”</p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"text-medium text-small-medium\" style=\"color: #1d57a5;\">Keeping siblings together</span></strong></p>\n<p>Their first foster child was part of a sibling group, but only one child could be placed with them at the time. It made a lasting impact.</p>\n<p>“We saw the grief of a child who’d been separated from her siblings,” Tracy says. “So when she left our care, we decided we wanted a bigger family home so we could <a href=\"https://www.thefca.co.uk/about-fostering/types-of-fostering/fostering-siblings/\">foster sibling groups</a>. We wanted to keep them together.”</p>\n<p>That decision shaped everything that came next. Now Tracy and her husband care for three sisters, aged seven, eight and nine. “I’ve had them for the last three years,” she says proudly. “They’re long-term matched with me.”</p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"text-medium text-small-medium\" style=\"color: #1d57a5;\">Watching children thrive</span></strong></p>\n<p>For Tracy, the real highlights of fostering are the moments of growth.</p>\n<p>“The highlights of fostering, I’d say, are seeing the child thrive, grow and smile in your care,” she says. “To know that they can be happy and get on with their lives and still have contact with their birth family.”</p>\n<p>One teenager stands out in her mind.</p>\n<p>“She came into care having lots of difficulties at school. Through care, nurture and help, we got her back into a mainstream school. We got her the help she needed — the diagnoses she needed. She was actually dyslexic, but she’d been classed as a naughty child, a distracted child. With support, she sat her exams. That was a massive change.”</p>\n            </div>\n        \n        \n            </div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div id=\"image-text-block_cd3b6a5d4cfd61c6e5ee8d814052f518\" class=\"custom-block image-text-block alignfull image-right has-none-background-color theme-none spacing-top-half spacing-bottom-full width-full\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"content\">\n            <p><span class=\"text-medium text-small-medium\" style=\"color: #1d57a5;\"><strong>“The support with FCA is absolutely amazing.”</strong></span></p>\n<p>When Tracy talks about FCA, she doesn’t hesitate. “The support with FCA is absolutely amazing — one of the main reasons we made the decision to go with this agency,” she says.</p>\n<p>And the support comes in all shapes and sizes.</p>\n<p>“It’s foster carer get-togethers, activities they put on for the children — including birth families. We have monthly support groups in the North West. We meet at the Chorley office. There’s always something going on.”</p>\n<p><span class=\"text-medium text-small-medium\" style=\"color: #1d57a5;\"><strong>Her advice to others?</strong></span></p>\n<p>“If you’re thinking about fostering, I’d say give FCA a call.

That’s why we’re taking cross-government action to transform life chances for these children and care leavers. This package of health measures will make a tangible difference to reduce health inequalities, keep more children safe and help more families with intensive support. It also delivers on recommendations from the independent review of children’s social care that I published in 2022. This government is delivering meaningful change to break down barriers to opportunity, especially for those in care.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Childrens Minister has achieved more in 4 months than the 11 previous Ministers did in the 8 years since the excellent Ed Timpson left the post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2026 promises to be a transformative year in the sector with more Regional Care Co-Ops being launched, the proposed Child Protection Authority being created and the forthcoming children’s wellbeing and schools bill being passed. This will enshrine in law a requirement for the government and public bodies to take into account the challenges faced by children in care and care leavers and the support they may need when leaving the care system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read more here: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/dec/23/young-care-leavers-england-free-prescriptions-dental-eye-services\">https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/dec/23/young-care-leavers-england-free-prescriptions-dental-eye-services</a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/news/government-extends-free-prescriptions-dental-and-eye-care-to-all-care-experienced-people-until-25/\">Government Extends Free Prescriptions, Dental and Eye Care to All Care Experienced People Until 25</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk\">TACT</a>.</p>",

Every year, around 36,000 children come into care; however, there are not enough foster parents available to care for them. This means vulnerable children are more likely to be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Separated from their siblings.</li>\n<li>Experience frequent moves.</li>\n<li>Live in residential care.</li>\n<li>Have their education disrupted.</li>\n<li>Live far away from the communities they&#8217;re familiar with.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Growing up without the stability of a safe and loving home can affect every aspect of a child&#8217;s development, from their ability to form relationships to the way they process and regulate emotions.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s why foster care is one of the most rewarding careers you can choose. Whether you provide a child with a safe home for a few nights or support them through school and prepare them for independent living, the work you&#8217;ll do as a foster parent can make all the difference to their life-long outcomes.</p>\n<p>Here are six more reasons why you should consider a foster care career in 2026.</p>\n                            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"content-block-block_32f3d291a34276433c5a62d0821047f3\" class=\"custom-block content-block alignfull has-dark-teal-background-color has-dark-background theme-none spacing-top-full spacing-bottom-full width-full\" data-columns=\"2\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n\n                    <div class=\"content\">\n                <h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">6 reasons to start fostering in 2026</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n            </div>\n        \n                    <div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n                                    <div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n                        <h3><span class=\"text-small-medium\">It’s a career that truly makes a difference</span></h3>\n<p>Unlike many desk jobs, fostering actively makes a world of difference. It’s crucial in helping to ensure the next generation of children grow up in healthy, secure environments with the chance to reach their full potential.</p>\n<p>Foster carers don’t just provide a safe place for children to live – they are role models, teachers and parents all rolled into one. With the help of foster families, foster children can learn to overcome trust issues, build confidence and grow into successful young adults with promising careers of their own. Many even go on to have careers in the foster care system themselves, creating a positive cycle of change.</p>\n<p>It’s not only life-changing for the foster children, but it’s also a rich, rewarding experience for you and your family. Fostering can open your eyes to new cultures, teach you things about yourself you never knew and give you a deeper purpose in life.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"text-small-medium\">You’ll leave a legacy that matters</span></h3>\n<p>Fostering is a career that enables you to leave a legacy that matters. Whether you offer long-term or <a href=\"https://www.thefca.co.uk/about-fostering/types-of-fostering/short-term-fostering/\">short-term fostering</a>, you&#8217;ll help children by passing on wisdom, supporting them through life&#8217;s ups and downs, and creating family traditions.</p>\n<p>It can be little things, like teaching a child how to brush their teeth, to bigger things like helping a teenager get back onto a positive path. Everything you do as a foster parent goes towards helping children develop independence and become the best versions of themselves. Now that’s something to be proud of.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"text-small-medium\">Thousands of children need a home</span></h3>\n<p>When a child enters the care system, they are scared and confused. Being separated from their birth family, even those who have been abusive or neglectful, can cause a child significant stress.</p>\n<p>In England, there are over 80 thousand children considered looked after, and they need loving, supportive foster parents who can provide them with the stability they need to thrive.</p>\n<p>When you decide to embark upon a foster care career, you’re not just choosing a job to pay the bills. It’s a commitment to giving every child the opportunity to live a happy, healthy life.</p>\n                    </div>\n                                    <div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n                        <h3><span class=\"text-small-medium\">You don’t need any experience</span></h3>\n<p>You don’t need to have superpowers to be a brilliant foster parent. Skills you’ve learned in previous jobs, through having your own children or nuggets of wisdom you’ve picked up in life, can play a big part in your role as a foster carer.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thefca.co.uk/resources/blogs/latest-blogs/care-workers-make-great-foster-carers/\">Transferable skills</a> like empathy, being a good listener, compassion, resilience, an open mind and having a bucket-load of patience are all traits we look for in future foster parents.</p>\n<p>You don’t even need previous experience in caring for a child. Of course, this is an added bonus if you have, but it’s the personal qualities that stand out to us. As long as you’re determined to make a difference, we can help you become a great foster parent.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"text-small-medium\">Professional development and 24/7 support</span></h3>\n<p>With many careers, it’s easy to hit a ceiling; however, being a foster parent means you’re always learning something new. At FCA, we understand that fostering is a career, which is why we actively encourage your professional development.</p>\n<p>When you join us, you&#8217;ll have access to our <a href=\"https://www.thefca.co.uk/about-us/training/\">high-quality training courses</a> where you can enhance your existing skills or specialise in specific areas, such as fostering children with trauma, disabilities, or autism. Our ongoing approach to training will equip you with the knowledge and skills needed to care for children with varying needs.</p>\n<p>Fostering with FCA is also like joining a big family. You’ll have a network of professionals at your fingertips, as well as a community of other like-minded foster parents to share experiences with. From dedicated social work <a href=\"https://www.thefca.co.uk/about-us/support/\">support and therapy services</a> to peer support groups and regular fun events in the community, you’ll realise that when you foster a child with FCA, you’re never alone on your fostering journey.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"text-small-medium\">You’ll receive a generous fostering allowance</span></h3>\n<p>Fostering a child has its challenges, so it’s only right that we reward you for your hard work and dedication.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thefca.co.uk/about-fostering/fostering-agencies-vs-local-authorities/\">Independent fostering agencies</a> (IFAs) pay more than local authorities, but the exact amount you get depends on where you live and the child you’re fostering.</p>\n<p>The allowances cover all the costs of caring for a child, including meals, clothes, bills and presents. You also get a minimum of 14 nights paid respite, which is where the child in your care lives with another foster family while you have a well-earned break.</p>\n<p>There are also additional bonuses for the length of service and hitting fostering milestones. The <a href=\"https://www.thefca.co.uk/allowances/\">fostering allowance</a> also gives you a number of tax exemptions and won’t affect any of your existing benefits.</p>\n                    </div>\n                            </div>\n        \n            </div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div id=\"image-text-block_0aa6c6e70e30e01a658f1bbfe8b55590\" class=\"custom-block image-text-block alignfull image-left has-none-background-color theme-none spacing-top-full spacing-bottom-full width-full\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"content\">\n            <h2>Start your fostering career today</h2>\n<p>We could give you 101 reasons why you should consider a career in foster care and why it is so important, but the main one will always be the fact that you get the chance to transform a child&#8217;s life.</p>\n<p>If you want more information about fostering, download our <a href=\"https://www.thefca.co.uk/guides/fostering-beginners-guide/\">Beginner’s Guide to Fostering a Child handbook</a>.

Together, they have three children of their own two daughters and a son and our proud grandparents to four grandsons.  Before becoming a foster parent, Annette spent 16 years working in a residential home supporting adults with learning disabilities, where she was a deputy manager. Today, her life centres around caring for her foster children and her grandchildren which she finds incredibly rewarding.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"text-small-medium\"><strong><span style=\"color: #e5007e;\">Why foster?</span></strong></span></h3>\n<p>Annette tells us what made her consider fostering “I think I always wanted to be a mum. I come from a big family of ten children, and I’m the fourth eldest, so having a busy household felt natural to me. After having my own children, I still found myself talking about fostering. I always thought that if I had the space and a spare bedroom, I’d love to do it. I admired people who fostered, I just thought it was brilliant.”</p>\n<p>“I never had the fear of ‘how would I give them back?’ If you do a good job, you know that’s part of the role, and you’ve helped a child. When our eldest eventually moved out, we had a spare room. One evening, while my youngest daughter and I were having dinner, she said, <em>“Mammy, all my life I’ve heard you and Daddy talk about fostering. Now we’ve got a spare room what’s stopping you?”</em></p>\n<p>That very night whilst scrolling through Facebook we saw an advert for FCA and clicked on it, that’s how it all started.”</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n                    </div>\n\n                    <div class=\"media\">\n                <img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"625\" height=\"622\" src=\"https://www.thefca.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Annette-Harkin-625x622.jpg\" class=\"attachment-half-width-desktop size-half-width-desktop\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.thefca.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Annette-Harkin-625x622.jpg 625w, https://www.thefca.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Annette-Harkin-365x363.jpg 365w, https://www.thefca.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Annette-Harkin-176x175.jpg 176w, https://www.thefca.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Annette-Harkin-299x298.jpg 299w, https://www.thefca.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Annette-Harkin.jpg 720w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px\" />            </div>\n            </div>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"content-block-block_05381d895d5e2cce135db5370404b2da\" class=\"custom-block content-block alignfull has-none-background-color theme-none spacing-top-none spacing-bottom-half width-full\" data-columns=\"1\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n\n                    <div class=\"content\">\n                <p>For their family, fostering wasn’t a huge shock. “I was a bit nervous at the start, because you never know what challenges you’re going to face,” Annette explains. But their children and wider family were supportive. In fact, fostering runs in the family as Gerry’s brother and his wife are also foster parents, so it wasn’t a big surprise that Annette and Gerry were taking the step themselves.</p>\n<p>One particularly heart-warming story involves a pair of twin boys. FCA called to match one of the twins with Annette and Gerry, while the other had already been matched with Annette’s cousin, who also fosters with FCA. At the time, Annette didn’t realise it was her cousin, though she recognised the family name. Although the cousins had never met and didn’t know they were both fostering with FCA, everything became clear once the connection was made. The boys were then able to meet regularly and form a strong bond. “It’s really brilliant,” Annette says. “My cousin is like a sister now.”</p>\n<h3><span class=\"text-small-medium\" style=\"color: #e5007e;\"><strong>Best fostering moments</strong></span></h3>\n<p>“When I think about some of my best fostering moments, our first foster child will always have a special place in my heart. Being our first, he made a huge impression on us.”  Annette explains.</p>\n<p>“It’s the same with our little girl we have living with us now, watching her grow in confidence, seeing her feel safe enough to be herself, is incredible and that makes everything worthwhile.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>For me, the best moments are seeing the children blossom, seeing their confidence grow, and knowing they feel safe enough to just be themselves. When a child can truly be themselves, without having to put on a front, you know they’re content and happy. That’s what fostering is all about.</p></blockquote>\n<h3><span class=\"text-small-medium\" style=\"color: #e5007e;\"><strong>Support from FCA </strong></span></h3>\n<p>Annette describes the <a href=\"https://www.thefca.co.uk/about-us/support/\">support</a> she has received from FCA as “amazing and outstanding.” She speaks very highly of her supervising social worker, who she feels she can confide in without judgment, gives her the space to express her feelings openly and she is always available if needed.</p>\n<p>“She’s one of the best <a href=\"https://www.thefca.co.uk/about-us/support/social-work-support/\">social workers</a>, she should be cloned,” Annette says.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"text-small-medium\" style=\"color: #e5007e;\"><strong>Suming up her fostering experience </strong></span></h3>\n<p>When Annette reflects on her fostering journey, she describes it as interesting and challenging but above all, it’s the best thing she has ever done.</p>\n<p>“I would have loved to do it years ago,” she says, “but at the time we just didn’t have the space. We didn’t have a spare bedroom.” Even so, she has no doubts that fostering came into her life at exactly the right moment.</p>\n<p>For Annette, fostering has been incredibly rewarding, she has formed strong friendships and become part of a close-knit community of fellow foster parents. One of her favourite parts of fostering is the monthly support group, which she looks forward. She values the opportunity to share experiences, learn from others, and gain fresh perspectives. Hearing how other foster parents approach similar challenges has helped her think differently and broaden her understanding. “It really opens your mind,” she explains.  Ultimately, while the impact on the children is what matters most, Annette says the friendships, family connects and support she’s found through fostering and through FCA have been truly amazing.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"text-small-medium\" style=\"color: #e5007e;\"><strong>What would your advice be to new foster parents?</strong></span></h3>\n<p>“One of the biggest lessons I’ve learned from fostering is not to take things personally. Children who come into your home might say some of the worst things imaginable. Often, they simply don’t know how to express how they’re feeling. It’s important to separate yourself from it, even though it can feel very personal in the moment.  I genuinely enjoy fostering. One thing I’d say to anyone considering it is: absolutely go to the support groups. Honestly, it makes everything so much easier. You learn so much and knowing you’re not alone makes a huge difference.”</p>\n<h3><span class=\"text-small-medium\" style=\"color: #1d57a5;\"><strong>Get in touch today</strong></span></h3>\n<p><a

The experience was very interactive, so everyone enjoyed it! After that it was rides, mini golf, food and Christmas games in the entertainment tent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We received some fantastic feedback from our young people!</p>\n\n\n<div

Only 1 in 3 children and young people aged 3-18 enjoy reading in their free time, and only 1 in 5 read daily.&nbsp;To try and tackle these issues, the Department for Education in collaboration with the National Literacy Trust have nominated 2026 to run a 3rd National Year of Reading campaign, with the theme title of <strong>Go All In.</strong></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-tact-brand-gray-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-51fded64e92d16b8397232412af9212f\" id=\"h-decline-in-reading-for-pleasure-in-children-amp-young-people\">Decline in &#8216;Reading For Pleasure&#8217; in Children &amp; Young People</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A decline in reading can directly impact on academic achievement, mental wellbeing and even future earnings.&nbsp; In the UK, currently 7.1 million adults struggle to read.&nbsp; Research has shown that children who are confident readers by the end of primary school <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/6867d497fe1a249e937cbcdb/Key_Stage_2_attainment_and_lifetime_earnings_reseach_report_-_July_25.pdf\"><strong>can earn £65,000+ more</strong></a> over their lifetime compared to non-readers. Disadvantaged pupils and those with SEND (Special Educational Needs and Disabilities) are also disproportionately affected by this decline in reading.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The National Literacy Trust have released findings from a recent survey focusing on reading for pleasure in children and young people aged 8-18:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Enjoyment:</strong>&nbsp;Just over 1 in 3 (32.7% &#8211; 34.6%) enjoy reading in their free time, a significant drop from previous years.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Daily Reading:</strong>&nbsp;Only about 1 in 5 (18.7%) read something daily for pleasure, a steep decline since 2005.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Age Trends:</strong>&nbsp;Enjoyment drops significantly with age, from over 70% for 5-8 year olds to around 40% for 14-16 year olds.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Gender Gap:</strong>&nbsp;Girls consistently report higher enjoyment, though the gap has narrowed as boys enjoyment fell less sharply than girls.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Socio-economic:</strong>&nbsp;Fewer children receiving free school meals (FSMs) enjoy reading compared to their peers.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-tact-brand-gray-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-ab2a00932429def3735127e583c99abb\" id=\"h-what-is-the-go-all-in-national-year-of-reading-campaign\">What is The &#8216;Go All In&#8217; National Year of Reading campaign?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Go All In</strong> is essentially the theme for the National Year of Reading 2026 campaign. It hasn&#8217;t been a regular annual event; previous campaigns took place in 1998 and 2008. What makes the 2026 initiative so different is that it will be the first to operate in the age of smartphones and AI. With online devices becoming increasingly important to young people, the aim is to promote a love of reading and transform the nation’s reading culture longer term.&nbsp; Specifically, the Go All In campaign aims to encourage young people to read about their hobbies, interests and passions (including music, films, food or sport) using a wide range of different formats to make reading more culturally relevant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Commissioned by the Government, the campaign is part-funded by the Department for Education &#8211; with additional funding and support from organisations such as Arts Council England, the Julia Rausing Trust, the Clore Duffield Foundation, and the Booksellers&#8217; Association.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the National Year of Reading website, &#8220;The ambition is that the National Year of Reading 2026 will make lasting change to the reading habits of the nation to reverse the decline in reading for pleasure and unlock one of the most powerful tools for equity and opportunity: a love of reading that lasts a lifetime.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout 2026, there will be a number of events and activities planned via the Go All In website. You can <strong><a href=\"https://www.goallin.org.uk/join-us\">sign up</a></strong> for regular updates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from the campaign, there has already been a significant investment in school libraries, with £10 million being earmarked to ensure all primary schools have a library. In addition, 72,000 free books will be given to children and young people in high-poverty areas in order to start positive reading habits.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/12/TACT-Education-Staff-Reading-Books-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Staff from TACT's Education Service planning for the Go All In National Year Of Reading campaign\" class=\"wp-image-18743\" style=\"width:800px\" srcset=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/12/TACT-Education-Staff-Reading-Books-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/12/TACT-Education-Staff-Reading-Books-300x225.jpg 300w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/12/TACT-Education-Staff-Reading-Books-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/12/TACT-Education-Staff-Reading-Books-768x576.jpg 768w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/12/TACT-Education-Staff-Reading-Books-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/12/TACT-Education-Staff-Reading-Books-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/12/TACT-Education-Staff-Reading-Books-800x600.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\" style=\"font-size:18px\">TACT Education Service staff catching up on their reading: Sam Gray (L) &amp; Tina Bull (R)</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-tact-brand-light-blue-background-color has-background is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-8cf370e7 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-tact-brand-light-blue-background-color has-background is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-8cf370e7 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-tact-brand-gray-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-8a4f6715f4c56528d3ccd7ca93837bc8\" id=\"h-what-are-tact-doing-to-support-the-go-all-in-national-year-of-reading\">What are TACT doing to support the Go All In National Year of Reading?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>TACT’s dedicated Education Service (who are all teachers who love reading!) are planning a whole calendar of events across 2026.

They also launched the Apprenticeship Academy, and delivered Bitesize sessions for <strong><a href=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/why-tact/connect/what-is-tact-connect/\">Connect</a></strong> members in a variety of careers, employability and education topics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Education service has provided a suite of training across the year to foster carers, staff and schools, including trauma-informed education, Wales Additional Learning Needs, Secondary Trauma &amp; Resilience, Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder and Anti-Racism.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Young people’s educational achievements have surpassed all expectations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In England, TACT had 13 children who took a year 1 phonics check in the 2024 Summer term. Eight passed, with 6 of those gaining very high marks and 2 gaining full marks. Of the 5 children who did not pass, 3 were very close. All of these children have since been provided with a PhonicsPlay subscription and foster carers have been contacted by the England Advisory teacher to offer some advice and support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a Year 14 multiplication check over the 2024 summer term, there were 18 children with recorded scores. 9 achieved full marks, with 13 in total scoring 22 or more out of 25 &#8211; bettering the 2024 national average. Those who did not pass were given free access to Times Table Rockstars, an online programme to practice multiplication tables.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Children who took their Key Stage 2 SATs achieved reading scores <strong>exceeding the national average</strong>, which was excellent news.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/12/Children-learning-in-a-classroom.jpg\" alt=\"Children learning in a classroom\" class=\"wp-image-18830\" style=\"width:800px\" srcset=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/12/Children-learning-in-a-classroom.jpg 1280w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/12/Children-learning-in-a-classroom-300x200.jpg 300w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/12/Children-learning-in-a-classroom-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/12/Children-learning-in-a-classroom-768x512.jpg 768w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/12/Children-learning-in-a-classroom-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Of the young people who took their GCSEs:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>22.7% achieved a grade 4 (a pass) or above in both English and Maths.

TACT were proud to hear that 2 young people got the grades they needed for university; one passed their access course and is going on to study Adult Nursing, and the other achieved BBC A Level grades and took up their place to study Law.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>TACT would like to congratulate all our young people on some wonderful achievements, where resilience and determination have truly paid off. These successes reflect not only individual talent, but also the hard work, perseverance, and positive support across TACT that continues to help our young people thrive.</strong></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/news/educational-achievements-surpass-expectations/\">Educational Achievements For TACT Young People Surpass Expectations</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk\">TACT</a>.</p>",

Here is her story</p>\n<p>After 37 years in the classroom, I was always determined that I would retire as close to my 60<sup>th</sup> birthday as possible.  I wanted to spend my retirement finding out more about life and enjoying new experiences, be it volunteering, learning new skills or travelling.</p>\n<p>I was aware that I would miss the company of young people and the joy of being with them as they grew and discovered the world around them.  I felt I still had skills to offer.  An invitation from the FCA fostering agency to attend an introductory meeting to looked interesting and a warm welcome from the social worker encouraged me to go further.</p>\n                    </div>\n\n                    <div class=\"media\">\n                <img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"625\" height=\"469\" src=\"https://www.thefca.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Alison-Baker-625x469.jpg\" class=\"attachment-half-width-desktop size-half-width-desktop\" alt=\"Alison foster parent FCA South East\" srcset=\"https://www.thefca.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Alison-Baker-625x469.jpg 625w, https://www.thefca.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Alison-Baker-365x274.jpg 365w, https://www.thefca.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Alison-Baker-875x656.jpg 875w, https://www.thefca.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Alison-Baker-176x132.jpg 176w, https://www.thefca.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Alison-Baker-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.thefca.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Alison-Baker-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://www.thefca.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Alison-Baker-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https://www.thefca.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Alison-Baker-397x298.jpg 397w, https://www.thefca.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Alison-Baker-952x714.jpg 952w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px\" />            </div>\n            </div>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"content-block-block_6733c1c7327e7f3590fd5d08cda881c8\" class=\"custom-block content-block alignfull has-none-background-color theme-none spacing-top-none spacing-bottom-half width-full\" data-columns=\"1\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n\n                    <div class=\"content\">\n                <p>I opted for <a href=\"https://www.thefca.co.uk/about-fostering/types-of-fostering/short-term-fostering/\">short term fostering</a>; I welcome children and young people for just a few days or weeks.  In some cases it may only be for 24 hours: I currently welcome a young person every month for an overnight stay.  The reasons why the young people need to come to me vary: it may be because their full-time foster parent is ill, or there is family illness, a bereavement or a holiday was booked before the child came to live with them.</p>\n<p>Since retiring eight years ago I have welcomed around 20 young people aged between 5 and 17.  and have greatly enjoyed being with the children who have stayed with me.  One young man came to me every summer for two weeks from age 11 to 17.  He first appeared as a very shy, nervous boy but grew into a confident adult who was ready to take on the world.  The longest period that a young person stayed with me was an asylum seeker who was with me for 11 months.  I’m an approved parent and child carer and have welcomed two new mothers with their babies for short breaks. There have naturally been one or two challenges, I have learnt how to manage type 1 diabetes and epilepsy, but our training gives us a good basis and the social work team is very supportive.  There are regular support meetings for foster parents and it is always a pleasure to get together.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.thefca.co.uk/about-fostering/how-to-become-a-foster-parent/fostering-panel/\">approval process</a> begins with a short introductory course which is designed to give the prospective foster parent an understanding of what is involved followed by training with and assessment by a social worker.  I found the training to be thorough; it often covered aspects of child development that I wished I had known more about during my career in education.</p>\n<p>I have appreciated the flexibility of being able to say when I could welcome a child and when it was not possible.  This has entirely fit in with my retirement plans and so doesn’t interfere with being able to accept opportunities to enjoy the theatre and cultural life and to take trips abroad.  Information about a child is usually provided in advance and I only agree to welcome children if I am confident that I can offer them a good experience; as it’s just me at home that can be very important.  In addition, the fostering allowance has provided a very welcome top up to my pension.  As a Waspi woman this has been particularly beneficial.</p>\n<p>Becoming a foster parent has been one of the best decisions I have ever made and I can wholeheartedly recommend it.  Spending time with some wonderful young people, having fun with them, listening to them, cooking and gardening with them and laughing with them has helped to make my retirement truly special.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"text-small-medium\"><strong>Get in touch today</strong></span></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thefca.co.uk/enquiry/\">Call our

Households celebrate Christmas in lots of different ways, whilst others do not celebrate it at all. However, as a period of national holiday, it provides many people with the time to take stock and to maybe think about how they can make a meaningful difference in the coming year ahead. For those considering fostering, Christmas can be the perfect catalyst for taking that first step on their fostering journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether it’s the warmth of family gatherings, the spirit of generosity, or the desire for a fresh start, the holiday season can encourage potential foster carers to explore how they can support children who need safe and loving homes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below, we look at three powerful reasons why Christmas is an ideal time to start thinking about becoming a foster carer.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-medium is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"293\" src=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/12/wreath-300x293.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-18705\" style=\"width:150px\" srcset=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/12/wreath-300x293.png 300w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/12/wreath-1024x999.png 1024w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/12/wreath-768x749.png 768w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/12/wreath.png 1280w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-1-christmas-provides-the-time-to-plan-a-new-start\">1. Christmas provides the time to plan a new start</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Christmas period provides a unique opportunity to reflect and evaluate on the past and to set intentions for the coming year. For many people, the festive season is the only time they truly slow down &#8211; whether that be stepping away from work and the usual routines, or just the rush of daily life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This quieter space sometimes prompts us to start thinking about a change of career or direction. If making a difference to other people’s lives is at the root of those thoughts, becoming a foster carer can provide an opportunity to sidestep into a rewarding role without the need for qualifications or previous experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many carers come to fostering from other sectors &#8211; some care-related but others from different sectors altogether. This diversity makes fostering accessible, whilst at the same time establishing a wide pool of foster carers that can be better matched to the needs of vulnerable young people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s important to highlight that fostering is a life-changing decision that the whole household must be on board with. It also involves an assessment process that lasts for several months. This is why the festive season could provide the time for information gathering – and to initiate those household conversations to evaluate whether fostering could be a fresh start for the coming year.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-tact-brand-light-pink-background-color has-background is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-8cf370e7 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-tact-brand-light-pink-background-color has-background is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-8cf370e7 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-9d6595d7 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:50%\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-tact-brand-gray-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-b14d040548ef180f64605a06a88ee26b\" id=\"h-2-christmas-is-a-reminder-of-what-truly-matters-family-and-connections\">2. Christmas Is a Reminder of What Truly Matters: Family and Connections</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The festive season can provide the emotional space to reflect, reconnect, and cherish the relationships that truly matter to us: family and friends.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether it’s gathering around the dinner table, catching up with loved ones we haven’t seen in a while, or simply enjoying the warmth of being together, Christmas reminds us that it’s these connections that enrich our lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, this period of togetherness can also bring to mind those who may not experience the same comfort and stability. Thoughts often turn to vulnerable children &#8211; those who may be facing the festive season without the same sense of family unity, warmth and belonging. While Christmas highlights the joy of connection, it can also shine a light on the children who need it most.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is why many people consider fostering during this time; it’s a gentle reminder that the nurturing family environment that we create at Christmas could have a meaningful impact on children in care.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:2%\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/12/Christmas-meal-1024x800.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-18666\" srcset=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/12/Christmas-meal-1024x800.jpg 1024w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/12/Christmas-meal-300x234.jpg 300w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/12/Christmas-meal-768x600.jpg 768w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/12/Christmas-meal.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-3-christmas-nurtures-generosity-and-compassion\">3. Christmas Nurtures Generosity and Compassion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The festive season is naturally built around kindness. Even if Christmas is not traditionally celebrated in a household it is, along with other religious festivals, a period associated with giving, sharing and thinking of others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a time when communities come together, when small acts of generosity feel more meaningful, and when we’re reminded of the positive impact compassion can have on someone’s life. For many, fostering is one of the most impactful and rewarding ways to truly make a difference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea of offering a stable, nurturing home to a child who needs one resonates deeply during this season, when the values of empathy, connection, and care are at the forefront of our minds. Foster carers provide children with emotional support, guidance, stability, and encouragement. They are generous with their time, and work flexibly to help children heal from past trauma, helping them to build meaningful connections and relationships.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But their impact goes far beyond meeting day-to-day needs; foster carers help children rediscover trust. They offer consistency where there may have been uncertainty, and they provide a sense of belonging that can help shape a child’s entire future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a child who has faced challenges or instability, being welcomed into a home where they feel safe, valued, and listened to can have a profound impact. Moments that might seem simple such as sharing a meal, receiving help with homework or celebrating milestones can be powerful stepping stones towards emotional healing and, eventually, independence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the festive season reminds us of the importance of kindness and community, it also highlights the incredible difference that foster carers make every day. Their compassion helps turn difficult chapters into hopeful new beginnings: something truly worth celebrating at this time of year and beyond.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-tact-brand-light-pink-background-color has-background is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-8cf370e7 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-tact-brand-light-pink-background-color has-background is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-8cf370e7 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-medium is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"271\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/12/A-christmas-tree-271x300.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-18700\" style=\"width:150px\" srcset=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/12/A-christmas-tree-271x300.png 271w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/12/A-christmas-tree-926x1024.png 926w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/12/A-christmas-tree-768x850.png 768w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/12/A-christmas-tree.png 1157w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 271px) 100vw, 271px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-tact-white-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-tact-white-background-color has-background is-style-dots\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center\" id=\"h-why-christmas-is-the-perfect-time-to-consider-fostering\">Why Christmas Is the Perfect Time to Consider Fostering</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">Christmas is more than a holiday. It&#8217;s a time to take a breath and consider a new start for the coming year. A new start that encompasses kindness, family, and truly making a difference in your home and the wider community. These values align perfectly with fostering, making the festive period a natural moment to think about whether you could offer a safe and supportive home to vulnerable children.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-tact-white-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-tact-white-background-color has-background is-style-dots\"/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">Whether becoming a foster carer has been on your mind for a while, or if it’s a relatively new thought &#8211; take the time over the holiday season to consider, reflect and, if relevant, to talk to other members of your household.

      "content": "<p>As parents, we endeavour to raise children who are healthy, happy, and ready to take on the world. Watching them grow into confident young adults and eventually leave the family home is such a natural part of life, but when that day comes, it can stir up a whirlwind of emotions. After years of sharing laughter, teaching life skills, and helping them believe in themselves, the house suddenly feels a little quieter. It is a big change, and adjusting to this new chapter takes time.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Is an Empty Nester?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>An empty nester is a parent whose children have moved out of the family home. Young adults leave for many reasons, such as attending university, starting a career, moving in with a partner, or simply beginning a new chapter in their lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This transition brings a new lease of life for some parents, offering the freedom to try new things and explore new hobbies with their newly found time. However, for others, the change can be emotionally challenging.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Challenges Do Empty Nesters Face?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It is natural for empty nesters to experience feelings of loneliness or uncertainty as the house becomes quieter. The familiar routines that once shaped the day, washing uniforms, cooking meals, supervising homework, being a taxi driver or simply knowing that a child was home safe, are no longer there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many parents find this shift surprisingly emotional. Often called ‘empty nester syndrome’, it can bring sadness, loneliness, and even a sense of grief. Missing the structure, the laughter, and the sense of purpose that once filled the day is common, and adjusting to a quieter home takes time.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Can Fostering Support Empty Nesters?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Even when children grow up and move out, the instinct to support, care for, and guide others often remains strong. Fostering offers a meaningful way to open both your heart and your home to a child or young person who needs stability, understanding and encouragement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fostering is not about replacing grown children. Instead, it brings new purpose and an opportunity to make a meaningful difference in a young life. It allows parents to continue offering warmth, reassurance, and a sense of belonging to children and young people who need it most.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Empty Nesters Make Great Foster Carers</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Empty nesters often make excellent foster carers for many reasons. Years of raising children provide valuable experience in navigating the challenges and milestones of childhood and adolescence. While having children is not a requirement for becoming a foster carer, this experience provides skills that are highly beneficial in caring for a young person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Empty nesters understand the daily responsibilities of parenting and preparing a child for independence in a safe and caring environment, which is the overall goal of fostering. Over the years, they also develop patience, effective communication, problem-solving skills, and emotional understanding, all of which are essential qualities for successful foster carers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Thinking About Becoming a Foster Carer?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The home may feel quieter now, but this next chapter can be filled with connection, purpose, and the joy of making a lasting difference in a child or young person’s life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are thinking about becoming a foster carer or have any questions about how fostering can help fill your empty nest, <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/contact/\">contact our recruitment team</a>, who can answer any questions you have and provide you with information on the excellent <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/fostering/support/\">support</a>, <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/fostering/training/\">training</a> and <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/fostering/fostering-allowance-pay/\">allowance</a> Swiis offers.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/what-are-empty-nesters-and-why-they-make-great-foster-carers/\">What Are Empty Nesters and Why They Make Great Foster Carers</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com\">Swiis Foster Care</a>.</p>",

Gareth has worked for Swiis for 8 years and loves working with the children in foster care who need educational support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In his free time, Gareth loves travelling and embarking on long treks, which not only clears his mind but also allows him to discover new places and meet interesting people. He has a passion for cooking, rugby, exercise, and DIY projects &#8211; he even recently converted an old van into a campervan! A fun fact about Gareth is that he once taught young people how to drive on a race track at Castle Combe. His dream destinations are Vietnam and Thailand, where he looks forward to immersing himself in the vibrant culture and cuisine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let us explore Gareth’s role as an Education Advisor, where he shares his insights on guiding foster children to unlock their full potential.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Your Role at Swiis Foster Care</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What is your job title, and how long have you worked for Swiis?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“I am the Education Advisor for Midlands and South, and I have been employed with Swiis for nearly 8 years.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“My role also allows me to support our placement support team in organising participation events and attending foster carer support groups to advise on how young people can be supported in their education.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What motivated you to work in foster care?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“I wanted to learn how to support children and young people outside of their school environment, support foster families and help improve their lives inside and outside of school.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What does your role as an Education Advisor entail?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“It is always evolving, however, my main responsibilities are to empower foster carers to support children’s education and outcomes and to ensure all children looked after within our care have the best opportunities to enable them to achieve good outcomes in their education, health and well-being.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What does a day in your role look like?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“A normal day would include discussing issues and concerns that have been raised with other professionals in a multi-agency context, ensuring information to support young people is shared, and to monitor, record and update young people’s progress and to attend education meetings. I am also involved in the participation of events and activities throughout the year.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Where does your department fit in the fostering process?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“Once foster carers are approved, I contact them and offer advice and guidance on how children and young people can be supported in their education. This would include offering guidance concerning policy, children’s rights, school transitions and those young people transitioning to independence, such as university, work and other apprenticeships. Throughout the time the children are with our foster carers, I support and advocate for the children and foster carers.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Fostering Insights</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How do you help provide foster carers with the correct educational support at home?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“Every child has a right to education, but some children who experience care, struggle in education for many reasons, including having to move to new areas on multiple occasions. This often means having to spend the first few days or weeks in the new foster home without education. My role would be to provide the foster carer with the appropriate resources to support the children’s learning, depending on their needs and abilities. Secondary to this, I would work with other agencies and schools to ensure that the most suitable school provision can be sourced, and the young person is given the opportunity to attend school at the earliest opportunity. As well as this being vital for their learning, it is also important for them to make friendships with their peers, appropriate adult relationships with adults and to give them social opportunities within their local community.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How does your role help to support the child in care and their foster carer?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“I would normally introduce myself and explain my role to new foster carers so they are aware of how they can be supported with any educational issues or concerns. Types of support include training in how to advocate for their young people during PEP (Personal Education Plan) and EHCp (Education, Health Care Plan) meetings, advising of their rights and responsibilities, advising foster carers and young people in how to use and access resources that will enhance and support their learning.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What are some of the most memorable achievements you have seen from a child or young person?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“Hearing the feedback from a young unaccompanied person who attended a university experience visit with the Swiis Midlands and South team. They informed me that the day would ‘stay with them forever’ and that it had inspired them to do well in their studies and attend a university in the future. The young person in question has since moved on to further education and is doing very well in his studies.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“Another memorable experience was being with a group of foster children on a day visit to the Donkey Sanctuary and seeing them all play, laugh and eat ice cream together. They loved the day out. This type of event offers children the chance to interact with peers and adults in healthy, supportive environments, helping them learn social and life skills necessary for future independence.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“Also, producing a Podcast with a young person who shared their thoughts and feelings on meaningful topics that affected their lives, such as bullying and identity. The young person felt extremely proud and hoped that it would help other young people. It is essential to provide foster children with a voice for their well-being and development, enabling them to express their emotions and thoughts. It also helps to shape decisions that impact their lives.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What do you think are the best qualities a foster carer should have?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“The best qualities I think a foster carer should have in supporting young people are to show they are interested and invested in helping them with their well-being and safety by listening to them, showing them warmth, being inclusive of their needs and including them as part of the family. By appropriately advocating for their needs when communicating with health, education and social services will also show the young person they are being supported and listened to. The best qualities foster carers can possess are a combination of emotional, practical, and interpersonal abilities.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gareth’s perspective on the educational <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/fostering/support/\">support</a> offered by Swiis highlights our commitment to empowering foster children and young people to achieve academic success.

Here are some other benefits of keeping a keen eye on your finances:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Prevents overspending and credit card debt.</li>\n<li>Allows you to put money aside for emergencies.</li>\n<li>Gives you scope to save for long-term goals, such as home improvements or that once-in-a-lifetime holiday.</li>\n<li>Helps you save for fun activities, special occasions, and weekends away.</li>\n<li>Keeps you in control and fully aware of your financial situation, which can reduce stress and anxiety.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Helps you provide a stable home for children in your care where all their needs are met and they have opportunities to explore their interests.</p>\n<p>Regardless of which <a href=\"https://www.thefca.co.uk/about-fostering/types-of-fostering/\">type of fostering</a> you choose, during your assessment, we’ll take a look at your financial situation to make sure you don’t have any financial obligations that could make it difficult for you to meet the needs of the children you foster. We also do this to ensure that if you experience a gap between caring for children, it won’t put you in a tricky position.</p>\n<p>This means it&#8217;s a good idea to get on top of your finances before applying to avoid delays during the assessment process. Below are our tips to help you get started.</p>\n            </div>\n        \n        \n            </div>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"content-block-block_a3d0b6cae6eca17530e43f3402d4a6ba\" class=\"custom-block content-block alignfull has-none-background-color theme-question-mark spacing-top-half spacing-bottom-none width-narrow\" data-columns=\"1\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n\n                    <div class=\"content\">\n                <h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Tips for managing your money as a foster parent</h2>\n<h3><span class=\"text-small-medium\">Create a realistic budget </span></h3>\n<p>The key to creating a budget that you’ll stick to is making it realistic. If your budget is overly strict, the chances are you’ll find it difficult to maintain, so be honest with yourself when you start the process.</p>\n<p>Obviously, your budget will include money you receive from your fostering allowance, benefits and job (if you <a class=\"Hyperlink SCXW28635768 BCX0\" href=\"https://www.thefca.co.uk/fostering-allowances/can-i-work-foster/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><span class=\"TextRun Underlined SCXW28635768 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-GB\" xml:lang=\"EN-GB\" data-contrast=\"none\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW28635768 BCX0\" data-ccp-charstyle=\"Hyperlink\">work while fostering</span></span></a><span class=\"TextRun SCXW28635768 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-GB\" xml:lang=\"EN-GB\" data-contrast=\"auto\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW28635768 BCX0\">)</span></span>, as well as non-negotiable bills that you pay every month, such as gas and electric, water, mortgage or rent, and insurance.</p>\n<p>However, to create a realistic budget that helps you stay conscious of where your money is going, you need to review your past and present expenditures. So download your bank statements and work out how much you currently spend on groceries, subscriptions, hobbies, and treats and add these to your budget. This way, you&#8217;ll see how much you have left over for savings or something you really want to buy.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"text-small-medium\">Set yourself achievable targets </span></h3>\n<p>If you want to reduce spending or save for something special, instead of eliminating everything that brings you joy from your budget, set yourself some realistic targets that you can actually achieve.</p>\n<p>For example, if your grocery bill has gotten a bit out of hand and you find yourself throwing food away, you could aim to cut it by £20 or £30. If you realise you have multiple streaming subscriptions but only really use one, you could cancel the others.</p>\n<p>These little tweaks to your spending will add up over time, helping you reach saving goals faster while still being able to spend money on the things you enjoy.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"text-small-medium\">Use a budgeting tool that works for you </span></h3>\n<p>Throughout the year unexpected expenses are more than likely to occur, so there’s no point creating a budget and never looking at it again.</p>\n<p>Find a budgeting tool that doesn’t feel like a chore to use so you’ll engage with it regularly. Here are some examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Planners:</strong> If you prefer to put pen to paper, a <a class=\"Hyperlink SCXW182759446 BCX0\" href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Budget-Planner-Organizer-Notebook-Effectively/dp/B08P48Z5VZ/ref=asc_df_B08P48Z5VZ?mcid=7df042aee03a3ba8837da9faadb63c2e&amp;tag=googshopuk-21&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=697341551435&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=17858278061153985505&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=1006656&amp;hvtargid=pla-1188691317800&amp;psc=1&amp;hvocijid=17858278061153985505-B08P48Z5VZ-&amp;hvexpln=0&amp;gad_source=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><span class=\"TextRun Underlined SCXW182759446 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-GB\" xml:lang=\"EN-GB\" data-contrast=\"none\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW182759446 BCX0\" data-ccp-charstyle=\"Hyperlink\">budgeting planner</span></span></a> could work for you.</li>\n<li><strong>Spreadsheets</strong>: If you are a dab hand at Excel, why not create a spreadsheet?

Before you know it, budgeting will become a breeze.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"text-small-medium\">Focus on your own financial goals </span></h3>\n<p>In this day and age, we’re bombarded with advertisements from retailers, travel agents and influencers persuading us to part with our money for a product, experience, or service.</p>\n<p>Couple this with our social media feeds being flooded with photos of piles of Christmas presents, new cars, and holidays, and it can be easy to get sucked into buying something you don’t need or can’t really afford to ‘keep up’ with friends and family.</p>\n<p>In reality, everyone&#8217;s financial situation is different, and you never truly know how other families fund their lifestyles or if their finances are in good health. Take buying a new car, for example, <a class=\"Hyperlink SCXW127962600 BCX0\" href=\"https://www.firstresponsefinance.co.uk/insights-and-tips/industry-news/uk-car-finance-index-2025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><span class=\"TextRun Underlined SCXW127962600 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-GB\" xml:lang=\"EN-GB\" data-contrast=\"none\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW127962600 BCX0\" data-ccp-charstyle=\"Hyperlink\">over 80%</span></span></a> are purchased using finance.

But you can still save money by being a savvy shopper.</p>\n<p>When you foster with FCA, as part of our support for foster parents, you receive access to The Exchange, our exclusive foster parent rewards platform. All you have to do is log in, and you’ll find discount codes, instant vouchers, and reloadable cards that help you save money on everything from daily essentials to holidays, days out, and more.</p>\n<p>It even includes a handy calculator to help you work out how much you could save, along with a SmartSpending app that gives you access to discounts and deals on the go.</p>\n<p><strong>Here are a few more easy ways to save money when you shop: </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use loyalty cards: From free drinks and exclusive discounts to vouchers for days out, holidays and more, loyalty cards are a really simple way to save cash.</li>\n<li>Buy pre-loved items: Whether you need a lawn mower, a bicycle for your foster child, or something else, Vinted, eBay, and Facebook Marketplace are your friends for saving money, with many items sold &#8216;like new&#8217;.</li>\n<li>Meal plan: Save money and prevent waste by only buying the food you need for your weekly mean plan.</li>\n<li>Have groceries delivered: When groceries are delivered, not only does it save time, but it also prevents you from adding things you don&#8217;t really need to your trolley, and you can see the running total while you shop.</li>\n<li>Buy discounted food through apps: At the end of each day, shops, restaurants, and cafes often have food that they won&#8217;t be able to sell the next day, but is too good to be thrown away. These businesses use apps like <a class=\"Hyperlink SCXW211092472 BCX0\" href=\"https://www.toogoodtogo.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><span class=\"TextRun Underlined SCXW211092472 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-GB\" xml:lang=\"EN-GB\" data-contrast=\"none\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW211092472 BCX0\" data-ccp-charstyle=\"Hyperlink\">Too Good to Go</span></span></a> to sell mystery bags of food and drink at a fraction of the original price.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Managing your money may sound like a bit of a slog, but over time, it&#8217;ll become second nature and you&#8217;ll feel better knowing that you have your finances under control. It&#8217;ll also free up your mind to concentrate on helping children and young people heal from their past, create new positive memories, and work towards a brighter future.</p>\n            </div>\n

Christmas may not be celebrated or acknowledged by members of the household, or there may be more deep-routed issues such as negative past experiences from the perspective of a young person. Whatever the reason, the holiday season can work for all members of the fostering household with a little forward planning and flexibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-left has-tact-brand-gray-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-205c09c007ba41638f0d92f1418ccd30\" id=\"h-differences-in-faith-when-fostering-at-christmas\">Differences in faith When Fostering At Christmas</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">One of the most important points to consider when we reach the holiday period is the <strong>differences in faith</strong>. If you are a foster carer who doesn’t celebrate or acknowledge Christmas, then providing a festive experience for a child who values Christmas may feel a little alien to you. Likewise, you may need to provide care to a child whose religion or upbringing is incongruous to Christian festivals such as Christmas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\">In these situations, a flexible approach is the key to ensuring that all faiths are represented and celebrated. A great way to achieve this is for both foster carer and child to talk about and introduce elements of their own religions into the festive season. Not only will this achieve a balance between the differing faiths, it will also function as a useful learning and bonding exercise. Social Workers will be able to support with opening these dialogues, and will be able to provide advice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\" style=\"font-size:24px\"><strong><strong>Here are our top five tips for any fostering households who will be looking to celebrate Christmas with the children in their care:</strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-tact-brand-gray-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-9e895adf2a5678bf14ebfc21b0599730\" id=\"h-1-acknowledge-that-smaller-gestures-can-matter-more\">1. Acknowledge that smaller gestures Can matter more</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As a foster carer, it’s natural to want Christmas to feel magical for the children in your care. You want them to have amazing experiences that they will remember and cherish, but this can inadvertently place a lot of pressure on children to enjoy the festive period in a particular way. This can be especially true if a particular young person has never spent Christmas with you before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a young person to come into seasonal visitors, tree presents, elaborate mealtimes and family games can mean that they become overwhelmed and alienated. For some young people, Christmas may be linked with confusion, family conflict, grief, or past trauma. There may be some anxieties around not knowing what to expect, or they may struggle with sensory overload. However, this does not mean that you should immediately cancel all your festive plans and avoid celebrating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best approach is to talk to your social worker beforehand, to get an idea of how the young person perceives Christmas. It could be that scaling back some plans, and placing more importance on talking and spending physical time with them may be better for their mental health and wellbeing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Smaller and quieter acts of consistency and care can go a long way to reassure a young person that they are safe, valued, and genuinely included. Ultimately, these gentle moments often matter far more than any big event or elaborate celebration, helping them feel truly at home during the festive season.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-tact-brand-light-blue-background-color has-background is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-8cf370e7 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-tact-brand-light-blue-background-color has-background is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-8cf370e7 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-9d6595d7 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:50%\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-tact-brand-gray-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-0e59175af2dad968c3ed18e8b5d726e3\" id=\"h-2-be-flexible-with-your-christmas-traditions\">2. Be Flexible With Your Christmas Traditions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For many people, traditions are a big part of Christmas time. Perhaps Christmas Day usually begins with the opening of presents, followed by a big festive lunch, silly party hats, tree presents, and an afternoon packed with games and laughter. These traditions can feel natural and familiar to you &#8211; but for a young person in foster care, they may be entirely new, or their past experiences of Christmas may look very different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s why flexibility is key.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before the celebrations begin, take some time to talk to the young person about what Christmas means to them. Ask about any traditions they enjoy, the foods they like, or the activities they’d feel comfortable taking part in. You might be surprised by the small but meaningful things that matter to them &#8211; something as simple as watching a certain film, baking together, or choosing a decoration for the tree can help them feel grounded and included.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where possible, incorporate their ideas into your festive plans. This not only helps them feel seen and valued, but also reassures them that their preferences matter within your household. Involving them in planning activities, deciding the day’s order, or preparing the home for Christmas can also build a sense of belonging and a shared ownership of the Christmas period.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By staying open and flexible, you’re creating a Christmas that isn’t just built around tradition, but built around the young person who is sharing the season with you. And often, those small adjustments can transform the holidays into a time that feels safe, inclusive, and truly special for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read more about <strong><a href=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/christmas-traditions-fostering/\">Christmas traditions in a fostering household</a></strong>.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:2%\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-vertically-aligned-center is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"682\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/12/Christmas-tree-682x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-18650\" srcset=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/12/Christmas-tree-682x1024.jpg 682w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/12/Christmas-tree-200x300.jpg 200w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/12/Christmas-tree-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/12/Christmas-tree.jpg 853w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 682px) 100vw, 682px\" /></figure>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-tact-brand-gray-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-b867a0c94fd2496f761b5a3d16b37c20\" id=\"h-3-try-and-avoid-moments-that-could-be-activating\">3. Try and avoid moments that could be &#8216;activating&#8217;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Christmas is often portrayed as a joyful, carefree time of year. However, for many fostered children, the festive season can bring up emotions that are far more complex. It’s important for foster carers to recognise that, beneath the surface, Christmas can activate emotions that could affect a young person’s mood, behaviour, and sense of safety.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For some children, Christmas is linked to difficult or traumatic memories. The sights, sounds, and routines associated with the season, such as large gatherings, loud celebrations, or even particular foods or songs, might remind them of past experiences that were unsettling or unsafe. These reminders can stir up anxiety and emotional distress, leading to instances of withdrawal or unexpected behaviour. In many circumstances, the young person may not be able to explain why Christmas is affecting them in this way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For others, the opposite can be true; a young person may have had warm, happy Christmas experiences with their birth family, and the absence of familiar people or traditions can feel deeply painful. Even positive memories can evoke grief, longing, or confusion, leaving them feeling unsettled during what appears outwardly to be a cheerful time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever the nature of these emotional activations are, recognising them early is key.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes, directly asking the young person about their Christmas experiences isn’t appropriate; they may not feel ready to talk, or they may not fully understand their own reactions. Instead, speak with your supervising social worker or the young person’s allocated worker. They can share any known information about past experiences, sensitivities, or specific scenarios to help you prepare thoughtfully.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With this insight, you can make gentle, informed plans that either avoid certain activating situations or reduce their impact. This might involve adjusting certain traditions, simplifying busy days, creating quiet spaces for downtime, or offering predictable routines to help them feel safe and grounded. With a little planning and awareness, you can help them navigate the festive season in a way that feels manageable and, in time, perhaps even enjoyable.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-tact-brand-light-blue-background-color has-background is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-8cf370e7 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-tact-brand-light-blue-background-color has-background is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-8cf370e7 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta \">\n\t<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta__inner\">\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta__left\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta__image\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"image-bubble\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2024/06/Bev-and-Mac.jpg\" alt=\"Bev and Mac first started fostering at Christmas in 2017\" srcset=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2024/06/Bev-and-Mac.jpg 720w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2024/06/Bev-and-Mac-300x234.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"quote-bubble\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<svg width=\"164\" height=\"144\" viewBox=\"0 0 164 144\" fill=\"none\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<path d=\"M33.4844 9.58621C61.8844 -8.81379 93.5 3.92638 109.484 9.58621C184.5 38.9263 175.484 121.086 118.984 138.586C62.4844 156.086 26.9844 122.086 9.48441 88.0863C-8.01559 54.0863 -2.01559 32.5862 33.4844 9.58621Z\" fill=\"white\"/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<path d=\"M90.7797 94.5568C80.2697 82.8104 87.4825 62.2025 96.3438 54.3716C103.763 47.571 116.127 42.0069 117.364 44.0677C119.218 47.1588 112.006 49.2196 106.442 54.1655C99.6411 61.5843 97.3742 64.8816 106.854 69.0031C116.952 73.5369 117.158 78.0706 117.57 83.8408C118.188 98.0602 101.084 104.655 90.7797 94.5568Z\" fill=\"#E11F8F\"/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<path d=\"M51.2119 94.3504C40.7019 82.604 47.9146 61.9961 56.776 54.1652C64.1948 47.3646 76.5595 41.8005 77.796 43.8613C79.6507 46.9524 72.438 49.0133 66.8738 53.9592C60.0733 61.378 57.8064 64.6752 67.286 68.7967C77.3838 73.3305 77.5899 77.8642 78.0021 83.6344C78.6203 97.8538 61.5158 104.448 51.2119 94.3504Z\" fill=\"#E11F8F\"/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</svg>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta__right\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"acf-innerblocks-container\">\n\n<p style=\"font-size:24px\">&#8220;He came to us when he was 13, five days before Christmas.

Take a calm and steady approach to Fostering At Christmas</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever your Christmas plans look like &#8211; whether you prefer a busy house full of visitors or a quieter celebration &#8211; it’s important to remember that the festive period often means everyone is under the same roof for longer than usual. Even in the most settled households, this can create moments of tension or stress. For children in care who may already feel uncertain or emotionally heightened at this time of year, the intensity of the holidays can be particularly challenging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adopting a calm, steady approach can make a huge difference. It may seem like simple advice, but creating an environment where the pace is gentle, the expectations are realistic, and everyone has access to personal space is often essential for supporting good mental health and wellbeing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Children and young people in care may be especially sensitive to noise, unpredictability, or crowded spaces. Christmas can bring all of these at once. By planning ahead and intentionally building in periods of calm, you offer them the chance to decompress and regulate their emotions before things become overwhelming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This could mean:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Spreading out activities over several days instead of doing everything at once</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Allowing downtime between social events, meals, or visits</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Creating a quiet room or cosy corner where they can retreat if they need space</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Keeping routines as predictable as possible</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Letting them know in advance what the day will look like, so there are no surprises</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>By leading with calmness, you will help set the emotional tone for the household. This not only supports the young person in your care but also protects your own wellbeing during what can be a very busy time. Sometimes, it’s these quieter, more peaceful moments that become the most meaningful part of the festive season.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-tact-brand-light-blue-background-color has-background is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-8cf370e7 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-tact-brand-light-blue-background-color has-background is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-8cf370e7 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta is-style-rtl\">\n\t<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta__inner\">\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta__left\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta__image\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"image-bubble\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2024/09/Kayleigh-e1764084162528.jpg\" alt=\"Kayleigh is an Innovation and Continuous Improvement Manager\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"quote-bubble\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<svg width=\"164\" height=\"144\" viewBox=\"0 0 164 144\" fill=\"none\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<path d=\"M33.4844 9.58621C61.8844 -8.81379 93.5 3.92638 109.484 9.58621C184.5 38.9263 175.484 121.086 118.984 138.586C62.4844 156.086 26.9844 122.086 9.48441 88.0863C-8.01559 54.0863 -2.01559 32.5862 33.4844 9.58621Z\" fill=\"white\"/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<path d=\"M90.7797 94.5568C80.2697 82.8104 87.4825 62.2025 96.3438 54.3716C103.763 47.571 116.127 42.0069 117.364 44.0677C119.218 47.1588 112.006 49.2196 106.442 54.1655C99.6411 61.5843 97.3742 64.8816 106.854 69.0031C116.952 73.5369 117.158 78.0706 117.57 83.8408C118.188 98.0602 101.084 104.655 90.7797 94.5568Z\" fill=\"#E11F8F\"/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<path d=\"M51.2119 94.3504C40.7019 82.604 47.9146 61.9961 56.776 54.1652C64.1948 47.3646 76.5595 41.8005 77.796 43.8613C79.6507 46.9524 72.438 49.0133 66.8738 53.9592C60.0733 61.378 57.8064 64.6752 67.286 68.7967C77.3838 73.3305 77.5899 77.8642 78.0021 83.6344C78.6203 97.8538 61.5158 104.448 51.2119 94.3504Z\" fill=\"#E11F8F\"/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</svg>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta__right\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"acf-innerblocks-container\">\n\n<p style=\"font-size:24px\">&#8220;Christmas can be a time of healing and connection.

Try to avoid conditional language</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many adults use conditional language with young people as a way of teaching cause and effect. It’s something most young people have heard at some point growing up, with phrases such as &#8216;if you tidy your room, then you can have a treat&#8217;, or &#8216;if you study, you will pass your exams&#8217;. These statements are familiar, well-intentioned, and often said without a second thought.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, for children and young people who have experienced trauma, neglect, or inconsistent care, conditional language can be confusing, anxiety-provoking, or even damaging. Additionally, some young people may struggle with vague phrases such as &#8216;being good&#8217;, which is not to say that they themselves are badly behaved.  In these cases, using conditional language can create unrealistic and unattainable expectations on young people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When fostering at Christmas, this becomes especially important. Phrases like &#8216;if you’re good, you’ll get some presents&#8217; may seem harmless &#8211; but for a young person in care they can create a fear of failure, and worries that they might somehow lose their gifts, or your approval. The child may also interpret the condition in extreme or distorted ways due to past experiences and trauma.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A more supportive and trauma-informed approach is to remove conditions altogether.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let the young person know &#8211; through both your words and your actions &#8211; that Christmas gifts, treats, and shared moments are freely given. They don’t need to earn them. They don’t have to perform or behave in a specific way to be worthy of kindness or celebration. This helps reinforce a powerful, healing message: <strong>they deserve care and joy simply because they are who they are.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>By doing this, you may also be gently unpicking old belief systems that were formed during difficult times in their lives. Showing unconditional warmth and reliability helps build trust, strengthens your relationship, and creates a sense of emotional safety during a season that can otherwise be confusing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The key point to remember when fostering at Christmas is that support is always available over the festive period, whether that be via your social worker, or a dedicated out-of-hours service.

In our <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/locations/yorkshire/\">Yorkshire</a> region, a group of musically talented individuals known as the Swiis Superstars have come together to create their very first original music track called ‘Our Moments’!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the lead-up to their production day, the young people dedicated time to planning, collaborating, and bringing their ideas to life. The group decided that their song would focus on growing up in foster care, and each young person played an important part in the creative process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One young person, J, a talented lyricist and rapper, wrote the lyrics by drawing inspiration from his own experience in foster care. Alison, a Swiis Senior Placement Support Worker, said, <em>“The speed at which J was able to put the words together was incredible!”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the lyrics were complete, R began experimenting with different sounds on a guitar to complement J’s words. After the group agreed on the perfect sound, E added in additional guitar tones, while P and S helped to create the beats, and PB added rhythm through their impressive beatboxing skills.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the Swiis young people, G, also played a big part in creating the song and was eager to use their talent on the vocals. Unfortunately, they were not able to attend on production day, but we are really looking forward to hearing their musical talent in the future!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When production day arrived, the Swiis local office was transformed into a lively recording studio, giving everyone the perfect space to come together and create their brand-new track.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the song was complete, the group also wanted to create a cover for their track. They chose a dragon to symbolise courage, and one of our talented young people brought that vision to life by mocking up a design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are incredibly proud of the Swiis Superstars for their teamwork and creativity throughout this project. They have such great passion and talent for music and have created a track to be proud of, and we are thrilled to share it with you!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Our Moment - Swiis Superstars\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Sx6aT5bKIOk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/swiis-superstars-release-their-first-music-track/\">Swiis Superstars Release Their First Music Track</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com\">Swiis Foster Care</a>.</p>",

It also promotes his continual development by assuring him that his efforts are recognised.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“He has always received positive recognition and praise where appropriate from TACT and ourselves, so it will ‘top up’ his sense of achievement.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"641\" src=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/11/TACT-foster-carer-Steven-accepting-an-award-1024x641.jpg\" alt=\"TACT foster carer, Steven, collecting an achievement award from Andy Elvin, on behalf of a young person\" class=\"wp-image-18435\" style=\"width:800px\" srcset=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/11/TACT-foster-carer-Steven-accepting-an-award-1024x641.jpg 1024w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/11/TACT-foster-carer-Steven-accepting-an-award-300x188.jpg 300w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/11/TACT-foster-carer-Steven-accepting-an-award-768x480.jpg 768w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/11/TACT-foster-carer-Steven-accepting-an-award.jpg 1530w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This award is a wonderful reflection of the progress our young person has made, both academically and personally. Their journey demonstrates how consistency, encouragement and belief in one’s abilities can lead to remarkable growth and development. For many young people in care, school can sometimes be a challenging environment &#8211; but with the right support, understanding, and motivation, they can thrive and discover their full potential.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At TACT, we believe that<strong> </strong>recognising and celebrating success is a powerful part of building confidence and self-worth. Awards like this do more than highlight academic achievement &#8211; they remind our young people that effort, resilience, and perseverance truly matter. Every milestone reached is a step toward a brighter and more confident future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This achievement is thoroughly deserved, and we are incredibly proud of our young person and the progress they have made!</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/news/school-achievement-award/\">Young Person Honoured with School Achievement Award</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk\">TACT</a>.</p>",

The patience, understanding and support that children of foster carers give to foster children and young people does not go unnoticed, and we are thankful for their dedication to helping transform the lives of others less fortunate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We had the opportunity to speak with Holly about her experience, who, along with&nbsp;her older brother, grew up as a child of foster carers. Holly’s parents began fostering with Swiis in 2010, and shortly after their approval, they welcomed a foster sibling group of two females and two males into their home. With the foster children ranging in age from infancy to six years old, Holly, who was just nine at the time, quickly went from being the youngest in her family to having four younger foster children in the home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She recalls her dad introduced the idea of becoming a foster carer, and because her grandmother had been fostering for years, Holly already understood what it meant to welcome children in need into her home.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>“I remember being really excited about it and excited for my dad’s new career path.”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Holly shared with us some of her favourite earliest memories with the foster children.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em> “The female foster children and I all used to love it when I would do their makeup and paint their nails when we were younger. I take pride in knowing that they have always looked up to me and I’ve loved watching them grow up into beautiful, strong, and kind young women.”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the years, Holly has been amazed at&nbsp;watching each of the foster children in the home grow and thrive. She has seen the youngest foster boys adapt to the challenges of high school and overcome any social difficulties.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>“I’ve loved seeing the youngest boys grow up and mature, and love that the youngest often wants to spend time with me just to chat about his day and ask me about my life. The two female foster children are at that age now where we can talk like friends as well as sisters, and I love being able to talk and gossip about girl stuff and have fun with them outside of ‘older sibling duties’!”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>As Holly became no longer the youngest in her family, it meant that there was a shift in the role she played in the household, she stepped up, taking on more responsibilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>“I feel like I took on a lot of responsibilities from a younger age as I felt a bond early on and wanted to help care for them the best I could. The last few years I’ve occasionally helped my parents with babysitting when they want to go out for dinner or enjoy a holiday away, or even small moments when they want to go out for a walk. I’ve always tried to help where I can in looking after them.”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Individuals like Holly leave a lasting impact on the lives of foster children and young people. She has played a significant role in creating a safe, stable, and loving environment by being a trusted and caring role model for them. Her dedication is a reminder of how the entire family plays a crucial part in the fostering experience, making a meaningful difference in the lives of those they welcome into their home.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Thinking about fostering?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re considering fostering and want to learn more about how Swiis can support both you and your children throughout the journey, <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/contact/\">contact our recruitment team</a> who can answer any questions you might have.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/children-of-foster-carers-hollys-story/\">Children of Foster Carers – Holly’s Story</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com\">Swiis Foster Care</a>.</p>",

At TACT, we’re passionate about helping young people to thrive, both on and off the field.

The week was created to recognise and celebrate the incredible role that the children of foster carers play within a fostering household.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether a foster carer’s child is young, a teenager, or has grown up and moved out of the family home, the children of foster carers often provide support to both their parents and the foster child or young person. Some responsibilities they have can include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Being a positive role model for the child or young person</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Supporting with everyday tasks, such as school pick-ups or cooking</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sharing personal things like toys, books, or games</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Helping them learn about responsibilities within the home</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Offering a listening ear and someone they can talk to</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout the week, we will be sharing case studies from children of foster carers to highlight their experiences and the vital role they play in the fostering household. These stories highlight how fostering has impacted their life and the amazing memories they have had watching foster children and young people develop over their time together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To kick start Children of Foster Carers week, we spoke to Lockie and Pippa, who shared what their favourite memory with a foster child or young person has been so far, what they enjoy most about being part of a fostering household, how their responsibilities may have changed over time, and any additional thoughts they wanted to share.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Lockie – Aged 9</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What has been your most memorable or special experience with a foster child?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“When we all went to Disneyland at Christmas. It was good having L to go on all the rides with, especially the bigger ones, because my sisters don’t like them. We like the Spider-Man ride the most, shooting webs with our hands and wearing the 3D glasses.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What do you enjoy most about having a foster child in your home?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“L plays football with me in the garden and plays Roblox with me on the Xbox. He’s getting better at playing with me, and it’s good having a boy to play outside with at football.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Have your responsibilities at home changed since your family began fostering? If so, how?</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“I help him and remind him how to be good, especially because my little sister copies, and we need to teach her to be kind.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Pippa – Aged 15</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What has been your most memorable or special experience with a foster child?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I have had lots of lovely memories of past and present little ones, building special bonds that last a lifetime, Christmases full of excitement and magic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Times when I come home from school to be greeted with 2 little ones chanting my name as I walk through the door, both wanting big hugs.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What do you enjoy most about having a foster child in your home?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“Fun and laughter everywhere, to stay with me forever.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Have your responsibilities at home changed since your family began fostering? If so, how?</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“They have stayed the same even though things have changed. I enjoy playing with toys and reading stories.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Is there anything else you would like to share about your experiences?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“I have found it to be really positive having my parents be able to foster, even though it does have its sad times, like when they move on to adoption.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>To view more case studies from Children of Foster Carers, take a look at our <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/info-hub/\">Info Hub</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Thinking about becoming a foster carer?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are interested in learning more about becoming a foster carer,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/contact/\">get in touch with our recruitment team,</a>&nbsp;who can answer any questions you have about fostering and provide you with information on the excellent&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/fostering/support/\">support</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/fostering/training/\">training</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/fostering/fostering-allowance-pay/\">allowance</a>&nbsp;Swiis offers.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/children-of-foster-carers-week/\">Children of Foster Carers’ Week</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com\">Swiis Foster Care</a>.</p>",

For some families, this means their child has spent most of their life as an only child, until the family decides to welcome foster children into their home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was the case for Summer, who grew up as an only child for 13 years before her parents began fostering two girls, aged 1 and 12 at the time. While the transition from being an only child to suddenly having other children in the household can be a big adjustment, Summer embraced the change and quickly thrived in her new role as the oldest child in the family.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like any change in routine, fostering comes with challenges that the whole family must navigate. But for Summer, the rewards far outweigh the difficulties.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>“I have a few things that I enjoy about us being a foster family. I love that there is always someone to spend time with and chat with. I also really like that when we became a foster family, Dad started spending more time at home because he left his old job, and now I get to see both Mum and Dad all the time, which is really nice.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“I like that we are a bigger family now. When our house and my Auntie’s house get together, there are over ten of us. We used to just be three, but now we are five, and I really like that.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“I also like that we all share things and help each other. For example, J played with my rabbit, Princess, last week, and while she was with her, she cleaned her out, which I was really happy about because that’s usually my job. In return, I helped J organise her wardrobe. We just do everything together.”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the past couple of years, Summer’s relationship with the foster children has blossomed, and together they have already created so many memorable experiences.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>“My favourite thing we have experienced together is our holiday. We have had so many amazing times, but without a doubt, going to the Caribbean as a family was my favourite. The things I took for granted on holiday, they were just so excited about, and I really enjoyed sharing those moments with them. Plus, every time we wanted to play in the pool, there was always someone to play with.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“Things like the plane ride stood out to me. I moaned about being on the plane for 9 hours, but they were so excited and grateful for just getting the opportunity to go on the plane.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“We also went zip-lining through the Caribbean Lake Park, which was really special. That is one of my favourite memories ever.”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>As Summer’s relationships with the children have grown, her role within the household has changed, and she has taken on more responsibilities as the oldest child.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>“It’s great how my responsibilities have changed! I used to have the jobs of dishwasher and recycling, but now J does the dishwasher, and I do the recycling, so we have split the jobs, which is good because I didn’t like the dishwasher, but J doesn’t mind it.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“I am the oldest now, so I do older sister stuff, like reminding P to put her coat on and trying to teach her how to fasten her shoelaces. I also taught J how to straighten and curl her hair.”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>As Summer has taken on new responsibilities at home, she has also had time to reflect on how fostering has shaped her life and how it might influence her future. When asked if there was anything else she would like to share about her experiences, Summer said:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>“Fostering has been in my life since I was really young. I was 6 or 7 when Auntie started, and then 12 when Mum and Dad started, so I am pretty used to the fostering world now. Since we started fostering, we have had really good days, but also some really difficult days. Everyone tells us ‘It’s a journey’, but that’s because it actually is.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“I’m really happy with where we are now though, life’s normal for us. I feel really proud that we foster, and I have even started thinking about becoming a foster carer myself when I’m older. I’m going to finish Uni and get my degree, but I really do think I will take a similar path and foster. I want to foster teens. Seeing how J opened up to me when we chatted, I think I’d be good with teens.”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Summer’s inspiring story of growing up as the child of foster carers highlights the incredible experiences and memories that fostering has given her, as well as how it has influenced her future. Fostering can be a life-changing experience for everyone involved, not just the children and young people in care, but for the entire family.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Thinking about becoming a foster carer?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are interested in learning more about becoming a foster carer,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/contact/\">get in touch with our recruitment team,</a>&nbsp;who can answer any questions you have about fostering and provide you with information on the excellent&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/fostering/support/\">support</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/fostering/training/\">training</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/fostering/fostering-allowance-pay/\">allowance</a>&nbsp;Swiis offers.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/children-of-foster-carers-summers-story/\">Children of Foster Carers &#8211; Summer’s Story </a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com\">Swiis Foster Care</a>.</p>",

For many children of foster carers, it means learning to share their home, toys and even their parents&#8217; time, but for those older children who are now adults no longer living at home, fostering impacts them differently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This has been the case for Harmeet, as when her parents decided to foster, she was no longer living in the family household, but she still experienced the rewards of fostering and found ways to support her parents and the children in their care.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>“Seeing a foster child feeling safe and happy at home is rewarding because we are able to work together and provide a stable and caring environment. Even though I don’t live at home, I support my parents by helping care for the children when they are away for the day. It’s meaningful to be part of that support system and contribute in any way I can.”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Fostering brings many new responsibilities, and it is not only the foster carers themselves who have a change in responsibility, but also everyone close to them who plays a part in supporting the journey. For Harmeet, she has played a massive part in supporting her parents with the children and young people they foster, and it has taught her valuable emotional and interpersonal skills.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>“My responsibilities have changed since my parents began fostering. Even though I no longer live at home, I now help more with caring for the foster children when I visit or when my parents are out for the day.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“I might play with them, help with meals, or just keep them company so they feel safe and supported. It has taught me the importance of consistency and patience, and I feel proud to be part of something that really makes a difference.”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the years that Harmeet’s parents have fostered, she has built many wonderful memories with the children and young people who have joined their family. Each new arrival has brought new experiences, and Harmeet continues to form special bonds with all the children her parents look after, making a lasting impact on her.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>“One of the most memorable experiences I had was with a foster child who came into our home at the age of 3. From the beginning, we built a strong and positive bond. I enjoyed getting her small toys and gifts, which always brought her joy. Although I no longer see her in person as often, we stay connected through regular video calls. She lights up with excitement every time we talk, and seeing that joy reminds me how meaningful even the smallest connections can be in a child’s life.”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Harmeet’s story highlights that even when a child of foster carers is an adult and no longer living in the family home, they can still be deeply impacted by the rewarding experiences that fostering brings. It has given Harmeet a new perspective on responsibility and shown her just how meaningful fostering can be in a child or young person’s life.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Thinking about becoming a foster carer?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are interested in learning more about becoming a foster carer,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/contact/\">get in touch with our recruitment team,</a>&nbsp;who can answer any questions you have about fostering and provide you with information on the excellent&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/fostering/support/\">support</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/fostering/training/\">training</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/fostering/fostering-allowance-pay/\">allowance</a>&nbsp;Swiis offers.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/children-of-foster-carers-harmeets-story/\">Children of Foster Carers &#8211; Harmeet&#8217;s Story</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com\">Swiis Foster Care</a>.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Being a child of a foster carer can open a world of new experiences and shape your life in ways you might never expect. For Rachel, this allowed her to witness firsthand the impact that care, support, and guidance can have on a child’s life. Rachel&#8217;s mother&#8217;s decision to foster not only shaped the dynamics of their family but also inspired Rachel’s own path in life, leading her to become a foster carer herself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rachel has always believed that the rewards of welcoming foster children into her household far outweigh any challenges. For her, the addition of foster children and young people felt natural, and a lot of her daily life remained the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>“Having foster children was great, it was like inviting our ‘bonus family’ into our home. We extended our family to those who need it most and seeing them grow and progress into young adults is one of the most rewarding things I have experienced.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“I also don’t feel anything changed when we gained our bonus family. We made sure they felt safe and secure, but we lived our lives as normal with our new additions.”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>During the years of being a child of a foster carer, Rachel was part of countless special memories that ranged from small, everyday moments to life-changing events. From playful afternoons in the garden to the celebrations of important milestones, these experiences left a lasting impression on her.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>“Over the time that my mother was a foster carer, we had many memorable experiences, so it&#8217;s hard to choose one! I remember setting up a water slide in our garden on a summer&#8217;s day, which ended up in a big water fight with lots of laughs! We have shared memories on holidays, life celebrations, and milestones. One of the biggest highlights was when we had the honour of reuniting a child with her mother after around 10 years of separation. It brought tears to everyone’s eyes. What an amazing moment to be a part of!”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The impact of fostering as a child of a foster carer stayed with Rachel, and today she has followed in her mother’s footsteps, becoming a foster carer herself, which Rachel would encourage all to try if they can.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>“I would like to add that if anyone is considering fostering but unsure due to their birth children, in my experience, it added a level of gratitude, empathy, and love that I wouldn’t have experienced if my mother didn’t foster. Seeing those children grow to the amazing individuals they are today encouraged me to become a foster carer myself. I have now been doing this for almost three years, and I’ve enjoyed it from day one.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“Give it a go and change some lives!”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>To read more about Rachel and her mother, Vicky’s fostering journey, you can read their story <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/story/vicky-and-rachels-fostering-story/\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Thinking about becoming a foster carer?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are interested in learning more about becoming a foster carer,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/contact/\">get in touch with our recruitment team,</a>&nbsp;who can answer any questions you have about fostering and provide you with information on the excellent&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/fostering/support/\">support</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/fostering/training/\">training</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/fostering/fostering-allowance-pay/\">allowance</a>&nbsp;Swiis offers.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/children-of-foster-carers-rachels-story/\">Children of Foster Carers – Rachel’s Story</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com\">Swiis Foster Care</a>.</p>",

She decided to look into it. She&#8217;s now been a TACT foster carer for 17 years.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many years ago I was helping out in the local school, and one of the teachers was a TACT foster carer and she kept saying to me ‘you could do this &#8211; the way you are with children’. So it was actually one of the school teachers that got me into this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I gave TACT a call, hoping that they were going to take me seriously &#8211; and I&#8217;m still here 17 years later.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-tact-brand-gray-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-530a69ab49bf5c75173cc4b0d8d9acc3\" id=\"h-you-can-foster-as-a-family\">You can foster as a family</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When I did look into [fostering] further, we only had my son Ben at home at the time – the other three had left. Ben was 9 when I first started to look into it, and by the time TACT had come out and done all their investigations, and I&#8217;d done the Skills to Foster course &#8211; we actually became foster carers when our own son was 10.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ben&#8217;s always grown up around other foster children because his best friends in school were twins and they were both fostered. So he understood the fostering side of looking after children. He actually just thrived with the six year old little boy. They both had the same interests &#8211; it just worked really well.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think Ben ever had his face put out of joint because this isn&#8217;t <em>my</em> adventure, this is our family adventure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>TACT always do a yearly annual summer trip and things like that, then they do the Christmas parties and discos. One year we actually did Disneyland, Paris &#8211; so my own son actually came along and joined in on that as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-tact-brand-light-blue-background-color has-background is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-8cf370e7 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-8cf370e7 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta \">\n\t<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta__inner\">\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta__left\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta__image\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"image-bubble\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/Foster-carer-Trina-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"This it Trina, a TACT foster carer in her back garden\" srcset=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/Foster-carer-Trina-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/Foster-carer-Trina-300x200.jpg 300w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/Foster-carer-Trina-768x512.jpg 768w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/Foster-carer-Trina-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/Foster-carer-Trina-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/Foster-carer-Trina-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"quote-bubble\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<svg width=\"164\" height=\"144\" viewBox=\"0 0 164 144\" fill=\"none\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<path d=\"M33.4844 9.58621C61.8844 -8.81379 93.5 3.92638 109.484 9.58621C184.5 38.9263 175.484 121.086 118.984 138.586C62.4844 156.086 26.9844 122.086 9.48441 88.0863C-8.01559 54.0863 -2.01559 32.5862 33.4844 9.58621Z\" fill=\"white\"/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<path d=\"M90.7797 94.5568C80.2697 82.8104 87.4825 62.2025 96.3438 54.3716C103.763 47.571 116.127 42.0069 117.364 44.0677C119.218 47.1588 112.006 49.2196 106.442 54.1655C99.6411 61.5843 97.3742 64.8816 106.854 69.0031C116.952 73.5369 117.158 78.0706 117.57 83.8408C118.188 98.0602 101.084 104.655 90.7797 94.5568Z\" fill=\"#E11F8F\"/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<path d=\"M51.2119 94.3504C40.7019 82.604 47.9146 61.9961 56.776 54.1652C64.1948 47.3646 76.5595 41.8005 77.796 43.8613C79.6507 46.9524 72.438 49.0133 66.8738 53.9592C60.0733 61.378 57.8064 64.6752 67.286 68.7967C77.3838 73.3305 77.5899 77.8642 78.0021 83.6344C78.6203 97.8538 61.5158 104.448 51.2119 94.3504Z\" fill=\"#E11F8F\"/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</svg>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta__right\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"acf-innerblocks-container\">\n\n<p style=\"font-size:24px\">&#8220;I just love what I do and seeing that little difference &#8211; you don&#8217;t have to see a huge difference you know, just tiny little steps.

It&#8217;s about being positive, not looking at everything that&#8217;s negative and helping them to develop confidence in their own abilities, so they can move on and realise that they can do things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The support from TACT has been superb. I have the finest Supervising Social Worker that any person could ever have. She is absolutely brilliant.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-tact-brand-gray-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-8fac86eba2729a991ac1d155f057d83c\" id=\"h-encouraging-a-hobby\">Encouraging a hobby</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My young lady [who I was providing care for] did some artwork. She was very keen on arts and crafts. I have a friend who does lots of art and crafts, and she runs classes. So I went along [with my young person]. I wasn’t very good at it, but she was brilliant. I went so that she would gain confidence. People could see how good she was. I learned a lot about colours and that, while I was there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I encourage all my young people to do things. A young person wanted to learn to swim, so I made sure she learned to swim. I try to find out what their hobbies are and then encourage them to do it. It just means sometimes having to take them places and then picking them up.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-tact-brand-light-blue-background-color has-background is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-8cf370e7 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-8cf370e7 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta \">\n\t<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta__inner\">\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta__left\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta__image\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"image-bubble\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/Aileen-TACT-foster-carer2-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"This is Aileen, TACT foster carer since 2014, standing in her kitchen\" srcset=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/Aileen-TACT-foster-carer2-1024x737.jpg 1024w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/Aileen-TACT-foster-carer2-300x216.jpg 300w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/Aileen-TACT-foster-carer2-768x553.jpg 768w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/Aileen-TACT-foster-carer2-1536x1106.jpg 1536w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/Aileen-TACT-foster-carer2-2048x1475.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"quote-bubble\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<svg width=\"164\" height=\"144\" viewBox=\"0 0 164 144\" fill=\"none\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<path d=\"M33.4844 9.58621C61.8844 -8.81379 93.5 3.92638 109.484 9.58621C184.5 38.9263 175.484 121.086 118.984 138.586C62.4844 156.086 26.9844 122.086 9.48441 88.0863C-8.01559 54.0863 -2.01559 32.5862 33.4844 9.58621Z\" fill=\"white\"/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<path d=\"M90.7797 94.5568C80.2697 82.8104 87.4825 62.2025 96.3438 54.3716C103.763 47.571 116.127 42.0069 117.364 44.0677C119.218 47.1588 112.006 49.2196 106.442 54.1655C99.6411 61.5843 97.3742 64.8816 106.854 69.0031C116.952 73.5369 117.158 78.0706 117.57 83.8408C118.188 98.0602 101.084 104.655 90.7797 94.5568Z\" fill=\"#E11F8F\"/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<path d=\"M51.2119 94.3504C40.7019 82.604 47.9146 61.9961 56.776 54.1652C64.1948 47.3646 76.5595 41.8005 77.796 43.8613C79.6507 46.9524 72.438 49.0133 66.8738 53.9592C60.0733 61.378 57.8064 64.6752 67.286 68.7967C77.3838 73.3305 77.5899 77.8642 78.0021 83.6344C78.6203 97.8538 61.5158 104.448 51.2119 94.3504Z\" fill=\"#E11F8F\"/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</svg>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta__right\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"acf-innerblocks-container\">\n\n<p style=\"font-size:24px\">“I encourage all my young people to do things.

They will miss the bus back so the most important thing is that they know that they can phone you. I always have a place of safety, usually it’s Sainsbury&#8217;s supermarket or somewhere where they can wait for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The advice I would give is that you&#8217;ve got to accept the ups and downs. There is going to be trials and tribulations. They trust you, they&#8217;ve got faith in you and they&#8217;re looking to you to help them. Be to be patient and help them to feel secure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve always had lots of ambition for my young people. I try very hard to instil ambition into them, but I have learned that some young people are just happy doing something different &#8211; they don&#8217;t all want to go to university. So I have learnt to look a little bit more at the needs of a young person, rather than my ambition for them. It’s about supporting them in whatever it is they want to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A highlight of mine has been a young lady who actually was determined she wasn&#8217;t going to be staying in the care system &#8211; but actually stayed for four years and then said ‘I would have made the biggest mistake of my life if I had left’. I watched her grow from a frightened little girl who had been thrown out of a family home with nothing and nobody, into a Deputy Manager at a store. When I see her in the store I sometimes look at that young lady, and I remember a 12 year old girl who was terrified.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-9d6595d7 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:60%\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"&quot;I watched her grow from a frightened little girl into a deputy manager&quot;\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RuPsuvFwaUs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-buttons is-content-justification-center is-layout-flex wp-container-core-buttons-is-layout-16018d1d wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link wp-element-button\" href=\"https://youtu.be/2zzYSaSNarM\">Watch Aileen&#8217;s full video</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\"></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-tact-brand-light-gray-background-color has-background is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-8cf370e7 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-tact-brand-light-gray-background-color has-background is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-8cf370e7 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-tact-brand-light-gray-background-color has-background\" id=\"start-journey\" style=\"font-size:50px\">Start Your Fostering Journey.

After all, it’s a role or a life choice that means that you open your home to young people who may have never experienced a nurturing and supportive home life. You provide care, guidance, help with school or finding a job. You’re a shoulder and a crutch when needed and are always there for them. You say the right things at the right times, are never wrong and can teleport anywhere in the country at will.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, that really would be superhuman.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in the real world, it’s hardly surprising that fostering can appear intimidating or out of reach for many people. They believe that they don’t possess the right level of skills or experience, or they think that they have to achieve life-changing outcomes for young people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What many people don’t see are the foster carers who come from different vocational backgrounds, who are just regular, ordinary people who want to help and make a difference. The people who understand a young person’s needs and are able to make the smallest changes that have the potential to be game changing for a young person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is how ordinary people make extraordinary differences, and as a charitable fostering agency we see it happen every day with our teams of foster carers all over the UK.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we want to highlight that you don’t need to be superhuman, that you don’t need to arrive bursting with childcare skills and experience, and by the very fact that you used to be a nurse, a bus driver, an accountant or a retail manager means that the life experience you bring will only ever augment your role as a foster carer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Let’s look deeper at three areas that could dispel beliefs or myths that foster carers need to be superhuman to make an extraordinary difference:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading has-tact-brand-gray-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-74cfff63c88cb1a387cd3061f31f3355\" id=\"h-1-coming-from-different-vocational-backgrounds\"><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Coming from different vocational backgrounds</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Whilst there are some specialist <strong><a href=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/start-fostering/types-of-fostering/\">types of foster care</a></strong> that may require previous experience of working with children with additional needs, most fostering types do not require any experience at all. This is because full training is provided.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we can go one step further than that and say that diversity with regards to previous vocational experience is highly sought, and actually achieves two goals:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>1) It makes fostering more accessible to those who don’t have sector experience and who want to make a difference to children’s lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2) It potentially creates wider <strong><a href=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/knowledge-centre/what-is-matching/\">matching</a></strong> opportunities due to foster carers bringing specific life skills and adjacent experiences to the role.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David used to be a bus driver but wanted to do something more fulfilling: “I was a bus driver. I hated it, but I just couldn’t find what I really wanted to do, so I just plodded on driving buses, and generally feeling unfulfilled. Then I saw an advertisement which posed the question: “Could you foster?” and I thought, yes, I probably could. And fortunately, fostering charity TACT Scotland agreed with me, which is why I am now a very proud and very fulfilled full-time dad of four children – foster dad to three siblings, and dad to my birth son.”</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta \">\n\t<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta__inner\">\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta__left\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta__image\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"image-bubble\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2024/06/david-ruth-and-jonas.jpg\" alt=\"Foster carers David and Ruth, with their son Jonas: 'fostering taught me how to share'\" srcset=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2024/06/david-ruth-and-jonas-905x1024.jpg 905w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2024/06/david-ruth-and-jonas-265x300.jpg 265w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2024/06/david-ruth-and-jonas-768x869.jpg 768w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2024/06/david-ruth-and-jonas-1357x1536.jpg 1357w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2024/06/david-ruth-and-jonas.jpg 1368w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"quote-bubble\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<svg width=\"164\" height=\"144\" viewBox=\"0 0 164 144\" fill=\"none\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<path d=\"M33.4844 9.58621C61.8844 -8.81379 93.5 3.92638 109.484 9.58621C184.5 38.9263 175.484 121.086 118.984 138.586C62.4844 156.086 26.9844 122.086 9.48441 88.0863C-8.01559 54.0863 -2.01559 32.5862 33.4844 9.58621Z\" fill=\"white\"/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<path d=\"M90.7797 94.5568C80.2697 82.8104 87.4825 62.2025 96.3438 54.3716C103.763 47.571 116.127 42.0069 117.364 44.0677C119.218 47.1588 112.006 49.2196 106.442 54.1655C99.6411 61.5843 97.3742 64.8816 106.854 69.0031C116.952 73.5369 117.158 78.0706 117.57 83.8408C118.188 98.0602 101.084 104.655 90.7797 94.5568Z\" fill=\"#E11F8F\"/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<path d=\"M51.2119 94.3504C40.7019 82.604 47.9146 61.9961 56.776 54.1652C64.1948 47.3646 76.5595 41.8005 77.796 43.8613C79.6507 46.9524 72.438 49.0133 66.8738 53.9592C60.0733 61.378 57.8064 64.6752 67.286 68.7967C77.3838 73.3305 77.5899 77.8642 78.0021 83.6344C78.6203 97.8538 61.5158 104.448 51.2119 94.3504Z\" fill=\"#E11F8F\"/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</svg>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta__right\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"acf-innerblocks-container\">\n\n<p style=\"font-size:24px\">“Becoming a full-time foster carer has completed my life.

Foster carers aren’t saviours, they are enablers</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>You may have heard fostering agencies or carers use the phrase ‘making a difference’ with regards to providing care for young people.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-tact-white-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-tact-white-background-color has-background is-style-dots\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>The reason why this phrase is used so often is twofold. Firstly it rightly avoids any unrealistic expectations; foster carers are not expected to swoop in and save the day (we have previously said that foster carers are not superhuman). They are there to make a difference to young people who have experienced varying degrees of past trauma. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-tact-white-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-tact-white-background-color has-background is-style-dots\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>This unpicking of current emotional responses caused by trauma experienced in the past is an evolutionary process involving a whole team around a child. A foster carer is not expected to ‘solve’ issues experienced by young people, only to use their training along with specialist expertise from the support network around them, to commence a process of healing.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-tact-white-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-tact-white-background-color has-background is-style-dots\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>Another reason why making a difference is a chosen phrase is to highlight that a foster carer’s role is to <strong>enable</strong> young people to take control of their own lives, to discover new hobbies, to decide what they want to do as a career. Providing a nurturing and caring home environment, where young people can rebuild trust and regain confidence provides them with the tools to start making their own life choices.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-tact-white-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-tact-white-background-color has-background is-style-dots\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>By removing unrealistic expectations from the shoulders of foster carers, we can start to see the most important traits that are required of the role: the ability to provide a safe, nurturing and caring environment to enable young people to thrive and take control of their lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-tact-white-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-tact-white-background-color has-background is-style-dots\"/>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta \">\n\t<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta__inner\">\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta__left\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta__image\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"image-bubble\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2023/06/Yasmin-and-Mohammad-2-e1731513607519.png\" alt=\"Yasmin, who is a TACT foster carer\" srcset=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2023/06/Yasmin-and-Mohammad-2-e1731513607519-1024x821.png 1024w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2023/06/Yasmin-and-Mohammad-2-e1731513607519-300x240.png 300w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2023/06/Yasmin-and-Mohammad-2-e1731513607519-768x616.png 768w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2023/06/Yasmin-and-Mohammad-2-e1731513607519-1536x1231.png 1536w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2023/06/Yasmin-and-Mohammad-2-e1731513607519.png 1940w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"quote-bubble\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<svg width=\"164\" height=\"144\" viewBox=\"0 0 164 144\" fill=\"none\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<path d=\"M33.4844 9.58621C61.8844 -8.81379 93.5 3.92638 109.484 9.58621C184.5 38.9263 175.484 121.086 118.984 138.586C62.4844 156.086 26.9844 122.086 9.48441 88.0863C-8.01559 54.0863 -2.01559 32.5862 33.4844 9.58621Z\" fill=\"white\"/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<path d=\"M90.7797 94.5568C80.2697 82.8104 87.4825 62.2025 96.3438 54.3716C103.763 47.571 116.127 42.0069 117.364 44.0677C119.218 47.1588 112.006 49.2196 106.442 54.1655C99.6411 61.5843 97.3742 64.8816 106.854 69.0031C116.952 73.5369 117.158 78.0706 117.57 83.8408C118.188 98.0602 101.084 104.655 90.7797 94.5568Z\" fill=\"#E11F8F\"/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<path d=\"M51.2119 94.3504C40.7019 82.604 47.9146 61.9961 56.776 54.1652C64.1948 47.3646 76.5595 41.8005 77.796 43.8613C79.6507 46.9524 72.438 49.0133 66.8738 53.9592C60.0733 61.378 57.8064 64.6752 67.286 68.7967C77.3838 73.3305 77.5899 77.8642 78.0021 83.6344C78.6203 97.8538 61.5158 104.448 51.2119 94.3504Z\" fill=\"#E11F8F\"/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</svg>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta__right\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"acf-innerblocks-container\">\n\n<p style=\"font-size:24px\">“By being a foster carer, you’re helping children to have an independent life and support them with the many challenges that they may encounter.

You’ve never heard someone scream so loud as when I gave her the tickets for Christmas!”</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta is-style-rtl\">\n\t<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta__inner\">\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta__left\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta__image\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"image-bubble\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2024/07/James-Alice.png\" alt=\"This is James and Alice, TACT foster carers since 2022\" srcset=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2024/07/James-Alice-1024x676.png 1024w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2024/07/James-Alice-300x198.png 300w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2024/07/James-Alice-768x507.png 768w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2024/07/James-Alice-1536x1014.png 1536w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2024/07/James-Alice-2048x1352.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"quote-bubble\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<svg width=\"164\" height=\"144\" viewBox=\"0 0 164 144\" fill=\"none\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<path d=\"M33.4844 9.58621C61.8844 -8.81379 93.5 3.92638 109.484 9.58621C184.5 38.9263 175.484 121.086 118.984 138.586C62.4844 156.086 26.9844 122.086 9.48441 88.0863C-8.01559 54.0863 -2.01559 32.5862 33.4844 9.58621Z\" fill=\"white\"/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<path d=\"M90.7797 94.5568C80.2697 82.8104 87.4825 62.2025 96.3438 54.3716C103.763 47.571 116.127 42.0069 117.364 44.0677C119.218 47.1588 112.006 49.2196 106.442 54.1655C99.6411 61.5843 97.3742 64.8816 106.854 69.0031C116.952 73.5369 117.158 78.0706 117.57 83.8408C118.188 98.0602 101.084 104.655 90.7797 94.5568Z\" fill=\"#E11F8F\"/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<path d=\"M51.2119 94.3504C40.7019 82.604 47.9146 61.9961 56.776 54.1652C64.1948 47.3646 76.5595 41.8005 77.796 43.8613C79.6507 46.9524 72.438 49.0133 66.8738 53.9592C60.0733 61.378 57.8064 64.6752 67.286 68.7967C77.3838 73.3305 77.5899 77.8642 78.0021 83.6344C78.6203 97.8538 61.5158 104.448 51.2119 94.3504Z\" fill=\"#E11F8F\"/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</svg>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta__right\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"acf-innerblocks-container\">\n\n<p style=\"font-size:24px\">“People often tell us we’re amazing for fostering and I’m never sure how to respond to that.

What matters most is providing a stable, supportive, and caring environment for a child. Many people mistakenly believe that foster carers must possess exceptional skills or qualifications, and be almost superhuman. But it’s the everyday qualities; patience, empathy, reliability, and a willingness to listen that make the biggest difference. Fostering is a learning journey, full of shared discoveries, growth and moments that will make the experience truly rewarding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Children in care benefit most from genuine connections from someone who is present in their lives. Someone who offers encouragement and creates a safe space for them to thrive – enabling them to eventually gain independence and to forge their own path in life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You don’t need to be extraordinary to foster, but conversely the sum total of the everyday care, patience and empathy you provide to young people could make an extraordinary difference.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-tact-brand-light-gray-background-color has-background is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-8cf370e7 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-tact-brand-light-gray-background-color has-background is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-8cf370e7 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-tact-brand-light-gray-background-color has-background\" id=\"start-journey\" style=\"font-size:50px\">Start Your Fostering Journey.

Shortly after that I became a military wife and then I raised my own daughter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One day a friend said to me &#8220;Do you know what, you should have a look at fostering.&#8221; And something clicked. So I decided to do a bit of research. That is basically what brought me to fostering.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The support from TACT East Midlands &#8211; it&#8217;s been spectacular. They&#8217;ve always been good, I’ve felt they&#8217;ve always had my back &#8211; always been there when I needed them. But also, they&#8217;re a nice group of people. I&#8217;ve known them for a long time now.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-tact-brand-gray-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-f45b46014cf324c71126fc4ce6d5e0e2\" id=\"h-a-favourite-memory\">A favourite memory</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A favourite memory with a young person I provided care for is that she and I used to read Harry Potter out loud Harry Potter together. That was our thing. Sometimes we&#8217;d include the rest of the family and we&#8217;d have two copies of the same Harry Potter book. You&#8217;d start reading and you could stop at any point. The person who was there listening had to take over at exactly that point. So it&#8217;s a bit of a game!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a great fun, and the laughter that came out of that! It went on for a long time &#8211; for about three years. Everyday we used to read. It started with just a chapter and then we&#8217;d read for an hour. Her reading skills are much better.

She couldn&#8217;t ride a bike and she couldn&#8217;t swim &#8211; although she liked to think she could. So we&#8217;d go out and we would do lots of ball catching games and we would take the bike out and do endless figures of eight &#8211; so she could get the hang of riding a bike and get her balance and all that. We facilitated swimming lessons and then we went and did lots of swimming as a family. Playing ball helped with her motor skills. Doing colouring and baking helped with her fine manipulative skills, and her hand eye coordination; that all helped when she started school.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We used to play board games after tea, and that helped her to focus and to understand turn taking and her understanding of rules.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s putting in place what she never got when she was little. It&#8217;s replacing those skills at a later date because they&#8217;re not instinctive. Now we&#8217;re seeing the fruition of what we put in place early on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At least several times a week we sit down to dinner, we talk about our day &#8211; we talk about what&#8217;s important to us. Is there anything going on in our head that we might need to question or go through? The act of sitting down to dinner, the act of laying the table and eating together and preparing food together &#8211; and then the clearing away and taking turns and being in the same space at the same time; that act really, really changes things. It changes people because it brings everybody together. And it means that you do use the space together &#8211; the space of being a family. Some of these children weren&#8217;t given the opportunity to have a meal, let alone where they had the meal and who they had the meal with. But when you do that and you make that a normal thing, it starts changing the way the brain works &#8211; and that is the beginning of changing their lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can make such a big difference to somebody&#8217;s life. My best advice to you is pick up the phone, click on that button and find out more. It will be the best thing you&#8217;ve ever done.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-9d6595d7 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:60%\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"&quot;It&#039;s putting in place what she never got when she was little&quot;\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OXuR_fpGEsE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-buttons is-content-justification-center is-layout-flex wp-container-core-buttons-is-layout-16018d1d wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link wp-element-button\" href=\"https://youtu.be/VxzmwPNXav8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Watch Kate&#8217;s full video</a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\"></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-tact-brand-light-gray-background-color has-background is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-8cf370e7 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-tact-brand-light-gray-background-color has-background is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-8cf370e7 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-tact-brand-light-gray-background-color has-background\" id=\"start-journey\" style=\"font-size:50px\">Start Your Fostering Journey.

She wrote a touching letter about her current experience in foster care with her siblings and explained why she hopes she and her siblings remain long-term with their carers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This young person would like to selflessly share her letter with the hope that it will inspire others and show the incredible difference fostering can make in the life of a child or young person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Names have been changed to protect the identity of the young person and foster carers.&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>“Sarah and David are quite literally some of the sweetest people I have ever met. They have always been so caring and supportive since the very first day we arrived, and I have felt like I have already gotten more care and support from them in just a few months than I ever got with my mam in 15 years. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wasn’t very keen on them at the start as I felt like I didn’t fit in. They are social and I wasn’t, they liked going out to places, and I preferred staying at home. And I guess I wasn’t really used to the environment of a nice home and family dinners and showers/baths every night.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My first night, I cried loads. I missed my bed, and I felt like I made a very awful decision. But they made me feel so welcome. The first day, I had a nice relaxing bath, they gave me my space and let us get what we wanted for tea. And honestly, nothing has really changed since that day other than that we are more comfortable around each other, and I am so much happier now that I got the chance to be with such lovely people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ever since the first day, they have always been there for me, no matter what. They are always so caring and helpful. They are so supportive of everything I do. Every time I am upset, they always notice, and they are right on track to figure out what is wrong and try their best to help with the situation. And of course, if I want or need any space, they will respectfully give me some.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not just them, the whole family are the most welcoming, caring and loving people anyone could ever ask for, and I feel like I warmed up to everyone quite fast. Living with them all has made me a better person.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My mental health overall has been so much better than it was while I was with my mam. I have a healthier diet. Sarah and David make sure we are getting proper, nutritious food, instead of fries and chicken nuggets all the time. They also make sure everyone is okay with having that food for tea, and if someone isn’t, then normally small adjustments will be made. For example, when they make Curry, we aren’t that big on spice, so they make us a non-spicy “curry”. (By “we”, I am referring to me and my brothers).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They always buy us things that we need, even if we don’t ask them to. Like one day it can just be brought up in a conversation, then a few days later it arrives. Obviously, they are responsible and try to teach us the value of money, so they don’t just buy us anything we want. If we want something that’s quite pricey or just a silly little thing, then we save up for it. If it is school related, or something crafty, just anything that would get us away from devices, or if its hygiene related, then they will buy it for us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They are quite chill and relaxed and don’t let things people say bother them. They are constantly reminding me that people will just say things out of jealousy or boredom and that I should just ignore what people think or say about me. If they want to do that, then they can go ahead and do it. Why should it be my issue, I know I&#8217;m a good person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whenever I am stressed, they always try their best to help me out as much as they possibly can. There was a moment when I was constantly stressed in school, and it would cause me to scratch my skin. Sarah wasted no time getting me a fidget ring and bracelet to distract me, and she would give me some cream for my wounds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Honestly, I have been such a better, happier and healthier person since living with them, and they have impacted my life in an amazing way. Even people at school have been saying that I look so much better than I used to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also have become a slightly more sociable, confident and productive person and I feel like I get more things done now. And I socialise with people a bit more since we are always going out. I have become more confident with myself, I used to be so insecure and now I don’t let that bother me as much. I’ve even been doing more and better at subjects in school because I don’t have as much stress as I used to when living with my mam. I have been able to hand in my homework on time, get a lot of work done in lessons, and revise properly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They are the reason I am the person I am today.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel like they would have an amazing impact on my future. I will actually have people to talk to about things like what to do when leaving school, how to find a job, how to deal with all sorts of payments, getting a house, college, and university. Just overall, how to be a good person.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel like I will actually have someone to help me through any hard times I have, someone I can actually talk to about things. I am no longer afraid of growing up, because I know that I am surrounded by amazing people who will support me and be there for me through thick and thin.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I lived with my mam, I was constantly afraid of growing up. I wanted to be dead by the age of 16 just so that I didn’t need to live a life like my mams.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sarah and David have given me and my brothers such a safe environment to be in. They have given us the opportunities to experience different things and to explore more things, to figure out what we enjoy doing and what we don’t enjoy doing. They don’t let us give up, but they don’t force us either. They just give us a slight nudge to get us started, then let us continue the rest.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They have made my life so much better in such a small amount of time, and I will forever be grateful to them and their whole family. I will always be grateful for everything they have done for us.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you so much for taking the time out of your day to read my letter. I really appreciate the chance to share a part of my story with you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have an amazing day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sincerely – N”</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Has this letter inspired you to become a foster carer?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>N has beautifully shown within this letter how much of an impact becoming a foster carer can have on a child or young person&#8217;s life.

The vote for quad biking, which none of them had done before, was pretty unanimous!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We took six of our young people to <a href=\"https://www.yorkshire-outdoors.co.uk/\"><strong>Yorkshire Outdoors</strong></a>, who kindly gave us a charity discount, where they got to try quad biking for an hour. The Yorkshire Outdoors staff were amazing with our young people, and kept them safe at all times.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It did get rather wet at times, but everyone really enjoyed biking around the track in the rain!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All our young people had a great time, and it was wonderful to witness them socialising and nurturing friendships made from previous social trips and events. We even managed to talk with them about our <a href=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/why-tact/connect/what-is-tact-connect/\"><strong>Connect</strong></a> community, which they are able to join upon turning 15. All were very excited to sign up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we spoke to our young people about the event, they all thoroughly enjoyed it, but it was the social aspect that they really appreciated:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I can see other children my age. The event was really good, I get to be myself, and I get to see [other] people in care, so I feel included.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I get to make lots of new mates and have fun at the same time.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I feel happy – it makes a difference in my life because I get to see my mates.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bringing our young people together for activities such as this is invaluable from a social point of view. Here at TACT we run multiple events, which means our children get to make new friends, and reconnect with more established friendships that they have previously made.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A big thank you to John Lewis and our Yorkshire and North East staff for enabling this wonderful event!</strong></p>\n\n\n<div class=\"swiper-container\">\n\t<div class=\"swiper\">\n\t\t<div class=\"swiper-wrapper\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"swiper-slide\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/Quad-bikes-all-in-a-line-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Quad bikes all in a line\" srcset=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/Quad-bikes-all-in-a-line-1024x920.jpg 1024w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/Quad-bikes-all-in-a-line-300x269.jpg 300w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/Quad-bikes-all-in-a-line-768x690.jpg 768w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/Quad-bikes-all-in-a-line-1536x1380.jpg 1536w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/Quad-bikes-all-in-a-line-2048x1839.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"swiper-slide\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/TACT-young-people-quad-biking-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"TACT young people quad biking\" srcset=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/TACT-young-people-quad-biking-1024x824.jpg 1024w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/TACT-young-people-quad-biking-300x242.jpg 300w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/TACT-young-people-quad-biking-768x618.jpg 768w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/TACT-young-people-quad-biking-1536x1237.jpg 1536w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/TACT-young-people-quad-biking-2048x1649.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"swiper-slide\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/TACT-young-receiving-some-quad-bike-instruction-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"TACT young people receiving some quad bike instruction\" srcset=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/TACT-young-receiving-some-quad-bike-instruction-1024x835.jpg 1024w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/TACT-young-receiving-some-quad-bike-instruction-300x245.jpg 300w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/TACT-young-receiving-some-quad-bike-instruction-768x626.jpg 768w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/TACT-young-receiving-some-quad-bike-instruction-1536x1252.jpg 1536w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/TACT-young-receiving-some-quad-bike-instruction-2048x1670.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"swiper-slide\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/TACT-young-person-riding-uphill-on-a-quad-bike-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"TACT young person riding uphill on a quad bike\" srcset=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/TACT-young-person-riding-uphill-on-a-quad-bike-1024x806.jpg 1024w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/TACT-young-person-riding-uphill-on-a-quad-bike-300x236.jpg 300w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/TACT-young-person-riding-uphill-on-a-quad-bike-768x604.jpg 768w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/TACT-young-person-riding-uphill-on-a-quad-bike-1536x1208.jpg 1536w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/09/TACT-young-person-riding-uphill-on-a-quad-bike-2048x1611.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/news/quad-tastic-event-for-young-people/\">Quad-tastic Event For Our North East Young People</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk\">TACT</a>.</p>",

Andy Elvin, TACT’s CEO and Chair of the <strong><a href=\"https://www.fairerfostering.org.uk/\">Fairer Fostering Partnership</a></strong>, has always been a visual presence in the media, showing that it’s one thing to say that you advocate for children, but it’s another thing to actually do it. Recently, our <strong><a href=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/why-tact/education-service/\">Education Service</a></strong> supported a young person to appeal a decision made by a local authority about whether they had Special Educational Needs (SEN) and required an Individual Development Plan moving forward.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our young person, who has been with her foster carers for 12 years, finished her GCSE’s this year (2025). Although she received additional support whilst at primary school, for some reason this ceased when she started secondary school – despite the fact that she still required this support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With challenges that included struggling to read, telling the time and numeracy, her foster carers were concerned for her future. Along with our team, they had been pushing to get additional educational support for her for a while. That’s when our Education Service stepped in to help.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-tact-brand-gray-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-808ff7ec8fbcb9281f3eeec44db14e74\" id=\"h-from-appeal-to-tribunal\">From Appeal To Tribunal</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When appeal and mediation efforts were unsuccessful, our Head of Education advocated on behalf of our young person and the case was taken to a tribunal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thorough preparation was critical and was a real team effort between our Education Service, Supervising Social Worker and foster carers.&nbsp; As a team, they were able to evidence and demonstrate that our young person met the legal criteria for having additional learning needs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tribunal process, which involved looking at reports and additional information from teachers, social workers, an Educational Psychologist and other professionals, proved that our young person had learning difficulties requiring educational support on a day-to-day basis.&nbsp;It was then agreed that her Individual Development Plan should be reviewed when transitioning into college.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"768\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/08/A-girl-sitting-her-GCSE-exams.jpg\" alt=\"A young person with special educational needs taking an exam\" class=\"wp-image-17366\" srcset=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/08/A-girl-sitting-her-GCSE-exams.jpg 768w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/08/A-girl-sitting-her-GCSE-exams-300x225.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-tact-brand-gray-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-7050dd7815b43f28950b8e1e545eb548\" id=\"h-the-importance-of-educational-advocation\">The importance of educational advocation</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Our Education Service strives to improve the educational experiences of our children and young people. The service not only provides advice, but will attend meetings such as PEPs (Personal Education Plans) or reviews where there are educational concerns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Should any further action be required, such as an Additional Learning Needs appeal, our Education Service can act as a case representative.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Advocation can achieve real results, and can change a young person’s educational landscape for the better. It is highly important that we continue to advocate for children and young people on an individual and national level to raise issues and drive solutions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read more about our <strong><a href=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/why-tact/education-service/\">Education Service</a></strong>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/advocating-childrens-educational-future/\">Advocating For Our Children’s Educational Future</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk\">TACT</a>.</p>",

      "content": "<p>&#8216;Children in care&#8217; over the age of 3 years old must have their own room. It may be possible for siblings to share a room if they are of the same gender, of an appropriate age, and it has been decided by the local authority responsible for children that this is agreeable. The Local Authority will assess each situation to determine if sharing a room is in the child’s best interest.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Would Foster Siblings Not Share a Bedroom?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While some <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/fostering/types-of-fostering/sibling-fostering/\">foster siblings</a> may have a close relationship, sharing a bedroom is not always the best option due to the complex emotions children often experience. Many children in foster care have undergone trauma, whether from experiences with their birth parents or the stress of being separated from them. In some cases, these past experiences can strain sibling relationships, even leading to conflict or bullying. In some situations, sharing a room can provide comfort and security, while in others, it may harm the child&#8217;s well-being. Therefore, the decision for siblings to share a room should be made on a case-by-case basis to ensure the arrangement benefits each of the foster children.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Does a Foster Child Need Their Own Bedroom?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A foster child needs their own bedroom as it is considered a safe space for them. One of the main reasons children enter foster care is due to abuse and neglect from their birth parents. Having a space to call their own gives them the privacy and sense of security they need and deserve. It also allows them to have a quiet area where they can read, play or do their homework. This is especially important in a fostering household with more than one child in it, as it can often be overwhelming to some, so a peaceful place that they can call their own is essential.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Do You Have a Spare Bedroom and Want to Make a Difference in a Child’s Life?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are considering becoming a foster carer and meet the requirements, such as having a <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/do-i-need-a-spare-room-to-foster/\">spare bedroom</a>, being over 21 years old, holding British citizenship or indefinite leave to remain, and being medically fit to work, then contact our <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/contact/\">recruitment team</a>. We will answer any questions and help you take the first steps toward your fostering career.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Swiis provides foster carers with the highest levels of <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/fostering/support/\">support</a>, <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/fostering/training/\">training</a> and <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/fostering/fostering-allowance-pay/\">financial allowance</a>.&nbsp; This enables our foster carers to give the children in their care the support and care they need to be supported and thrive.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/can-foster-children-share-a-bedroom/\">Can Foster Children Share a Bedroom? </a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com\">Swiis Foster Care</a>.</p>",

Three organisations are selected every three months, and then customers decide how much each organisation receives by using tokens to vote.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>TACT Fostering Cymru received a generous <strong>£2000 via the scheme</strong>, so the team decided to treat our young people to a day out in Llangrannog where they could take part in activities such as karting, archery, high ropes, tobogganing and bushcraft. The activities were followed by an awards ceremony, where each and every young person received an award in celebration of their achievements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The awards ceremony was a highlight for all. Chloe Meades, TACT Fostering Recruitment Manager for Wales and the South West, said: “Seeing all of our children and young people receiving an award for their individual achievements was a highlight for all involved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Also, watching the young people make connections with each other and swap phone numbers to keep in touch was really special.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/08/picture-9-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"The awards ceremony in Llangrannog\" class=\"wp-image-17281\" style=\"width:700px\" srcset=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/08/picture-9-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/08/picture-9-300x225.jpg 300w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/08/picture-9-768x576.jpg 768w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/08/picture-9-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/08/picture-9-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/08/picture-9-800x600.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Wellbeing and activity days have the power to making a lasting positive impression on young people. A TACT foster carer said: “The days out really help all children, and I feel something other people think of as ‘just a day out’ makes so much difference in so many children&#8217;s lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We have seen it first hand and cannot thank you all enough for everything you have provided and done for all our children. Even down to the awards and making each child feel special for their achievements is such a personal and lovely thing.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One particular young person ‘found her feet’ on the trip. Her foster carer said: “Our young person hasn&#8217;t ever been confident and doesn&#8217;t believe in herself at all. But on your planned days out we see a different side to her.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“She pushes herself and really puts herself out there. She’s tried new things and we’ve seen this wave of confidence come over her. It&#8217;s beautiful to see and it makes us feel so proud that she can try new things and be the person we know she is.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other feedback from our foster carers:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We loved the day out and the kids really enjoyed themselves too. The day helps the kids more than anyone would think and not just the foster children but my own children too. Our oldest young person has come out of her shell loads recently and she loves going on your day trips and your weekend trips you have planned. She has made friends with other foster children who can relate to her and her experiences. It&#8217;s been lovely to see her bump into children she has met before. It&#8217;s lovely to see her so happy and comfortable around people she hasn&#8217;t long ago met.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Thank you so much, he hasn’t stopped talking all the way home…he had a wonderful time.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;What a fantastic success the awards day was. Thank you TACT for a brilliant day out &#8211; we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The whole day was fabulous from start to finish. We all had a lovely day and enjoyed all the activities equally. It was so nice seeing everyone having fun. Also the awards was lovely. Even the food was lovely.

Read our top tips for planning these events, along with 5 activity ideas.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-tact-brand-gray-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-9b14df73264b5117835eea38abdf8705\" id=\"h-planning-ahead-is-key\">Planning ahead is key</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Planning ahead is not only important for high demand ticketed events, it also will ensure that both you and the young people in your household are fully prepared and are on board with any plans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To do this, start by talking to your Supervising Social Worker and all young people in the household.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-talk-to-your-supervising-social-worker\">Talk to your Supervising Social Worker</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Talking about some initial ideas for activities with your Supervising Social Worker is a great start before you talk to young people about potential plans. In addition, some activities may require permissions to be granted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your Supervising Social Worker will be able to provide valuable insight around possible triggers or situations that young people may find activating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, a young person may feel uncomfortable in large crowds, so this will be something to bear in mind when looking at potential activities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may already be aware of what a young person may find ‘activating’ from their Care Plan, but as your Supervising Social Worker will have a direct communication route to a child’s local authority social worker, it’s always a good idea to double check at this stage. This will ensure that you are fully informed and prepared to move onto the next stage: initiating a conversation with your young people and involving them in your planning.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-consulting-young-people\">Consulting young people</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This may sound obvious, but it’s important to highlight what involving young people in your planning will achieve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consulting young people and asking for their input is an important bonding exercise in itself. It will demonstrate that you value their opinions and will nurture feelings of inclusion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of finalising specific plans, you will be fully prepared to guide young people should they suggest any potentially triggering activities that could impact their mental health and wellbeing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When events have been arranged, talking about them regularly could help a young person prepare for them. Some young people can struggle with changes to routines so making sure they are aware that activities are imminent could help alleviate anxiety on the day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If you’re stuck for activities, we have 5 general suggestions for you to investigate with young people in your household.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-tact-brand-gray-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-83481ab46b1f6bde49b6d0d3eb0452b6\" id=\"h-our-5-things-to-do-in-the-summer-holidays\">Our 5 things to do in the summer holidays</h2>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-1-an-extension-of-their-hobbies-or-interests\">1. An extension of their hobbies or interests</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>A good place to start is with young people’s existing hobbies or interests. Looking for activities that are effectively an extension of their established interests could be perfect for them. Having some experience with the activity already, and maybe knowing what to expect, will also be advantageous if they are not used to trying new experiences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if they like football, being taken to a football match could be the perfect suggestion. Could that then lead onto them joining a local football team relevant to their age group?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If they like creative writing, are there any local writing groups or courses available?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Alice and James</strong>, TACT foster carers since 2022, knew that their young person loved musicals – which gave them the perfect idea for a trip away: “Our highlight might be taking a musical-obsessed teenager who had never been to the theatre before to see Hamilton in London. You’ve never heard someone scream so loud as when I gave her the tickets!”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nurturing their hobbies could be invaluable in terms of ongoing future activities, and could play a part in memory making.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-tact-brand-light-blue-background-color has-background is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-8cf370e7 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-8cf370e7 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-9d6595d7 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-2-your-hobbies-could-be-the-springboard\">2. Your hobbies could be the springboard</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Have young people expressed an interest in your hobbies or interests?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For young people to try new experiences with someone that they trust could be a springboard for them to discover a new hobby. You would also be able to provide knowledge, guidance and any necessary equipment. It could also provide another valuable bonding opportunity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Gemma and Jenilee</strong> have been TACT foster carers since 2020.

Encourage creative expression activities</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>As well as providing an activity, getting creative can positively impact a young person’s mental health. This is because creativity can encourage production of dopamine in the brain, commonly known as the ‘feel good neurotransmitter’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dopamine helps regulate how we experience pleasure and rewards. It&#8217;s closely linked to our ability to think, plan, and stay motivated. It also plays a key role in helping us focus and work towards goals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Creativity can take many forms. It could be creative writing, making music, producing some art, dancing or even experimenting in the kitchen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://blog.calm.com/blog/creativity-mental-health\"><strong>Calm</strong></a>, “Research has shown that engaging in creative activities like music, dance, painting, or even crafting is linked to lower levels of anxiety and depression. Creative arts often provide a sense of connection, whether through sharing your work with others or simply feeling more in tune with yourself. It’s not about being good at something. Instead, it’s about allowing yourself to explore and create freely.”</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-tact-brand-light-blue-background-color has-background is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-8cf370e7 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-8cf370e7 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-9d6595d7 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:45%\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"682\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/07/Young-person-baking-682x1024.jpg\" alt=\"A young person baking is one of our things to do in the Summer Holidays\" class=\"wp-image-17156\" style=\"aspect-ratio:1;object-fit:cover\" srcset=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/07/Young-person-baking-682x1024.jpg 682w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/07/Young-person-baking-200x300.jpg 200w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/07/Young-person-baking-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/07/Young-person-baking.jpg 853w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 682px) 100vw, 682px\" /></figure>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis:5%\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-4-create-theme-days\">4. Create ‘theme days’</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a straightforward idea that will require young people to be on board at the planning stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Ask them to come up with a list of activities that end in the word ‘day’, that can be achieved in the home. For example, ‘pizza day’, ‘film day’ or ‘treasure hunt day’. Working with the young person, you will be able to carefully advise or guide them on any activities that could be logistically impossible for your time or resources.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Get a calendar and ask them to write in when they would like to do each activity.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Be flexible with the calendar</strong>. If a young person doesn’t feel like doing a particular activity, explain that they can swap it for another and that the calendar is not set in stone.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Generating theme days is an excellent way of filling up long stretches of holiday time. Young people are fully involved in the planning and scheduling, encouraging responsibility and ownership.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-5-documenting-the-summer-holidays\">5. Documenting the summer holidays</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This one involves recording or documenting the entire summer holiday break using a medium chosen by the young person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, they could take photographs, write a story &#8211; or for the more technically minded, create and edit together a video.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compiling a scrapbook or collage to consolidate the summer holidays will not only provide an activity in itself, but will be something tangible for young people to look back on and remember.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If a video format was chosen, ensure that you take the time to watch the video back with them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-tact-brand-gray-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-a221d5eef1866e22a3839eea7106ed2a\" id=\"h-our-engagement-amp-activity-practitioners\">Our Engagement &amp; Activity Practitioners</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At TACT, our <a href=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/young-people-practitioners/\"><strong>Engagement &amp; Activity Practitioners (EAPs)</strong></a> help organise activities for our young people in the summer holiday period.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some examples of upcoming activities are trips to the zoo, a visit to an aqua park, a Go Ape day, a trip to a museum and a picnic in the park. Larger events include a trip to Colwyn Bay, and FoxFest &#8211; where our young people will experience Ed Sheeran and Taylor Swift tribute acts! Aimed at all young people in our fostering households, including carer’s own children, the activities cover various age groups and abilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>EAPs also organise one-to-one activities, such as trips to the circus, mini golf, bowling and local farm visits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our EAPs also signpost to activities over the summer, highlighting any special deals and offers via a newsletter. We find that this can help alleviate pressure on our foster carers to generate a whole programme of events for their young people during the summer holidays.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>No matter how you choose to approach the school summer holidays, it’s important to remember that not every day needs to be packed with activities or events. Young people benefit from having quiet time to rest, recharge, and adjust to the change in routine during the break from school.</strong></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/things-to-do-in-the-summer-holidays/\">5 Things To Do In The Summer Holidays</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk\">TACT</a>.</p>",

It was the first time two separate weekends were arranged to make travel easier, and the first time Centre Parcs was used as the venue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Centre Parcs turned out to be the perfect setting, with accessible lodges and a huge range of activities for the children to try out. The relaxed environment gave families the chance to spend quality time together and create some lovely memories.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"694\" src=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/07/Young-People-At-Centre-Parcs-1024x694.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-17040\" style=\"width:700px\" srcset=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/07/Young-People-At-Centre-Parcs-1024x694.png 1024w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/07/Young-People-At-Centre-Parcs-300x203.png 300w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/07/Young-People-At-Centre-Parcs-768x520.png 768w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2025/07/Young-People-At-Centre-Parcs.png 1138w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Feedback from carers was really positive, with many expressing how much they appreciated TACT living its values and giving children and carers the chance to enjoy something a little different:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&#8220;I wish to thank TACT for arranging myself and the young person to attend Sherwood Forest Centre Parc.

I thought secondary school was meant to be fun? The same laughs, same fingers pointing. At me. This is the reflection of a mirror broken years ago. Every break, every shatter the mirror multiplies but never breaks. The unbuilt anger sears my skin as my mind casts all the mistakes and regrets. I look around and notice the smiles. The unfazed and unscarred smiles. Weird glances are casted my way and I feel that numb feeling spread through my chest. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-tact-white-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-tact-white-background-color has-background is-style-dots\"/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">New year, new me right? I mean the start of Year 10 and I sit alone with mascara and lip-gloss on hoping someone will talk to me. They never do. I open my phone. No new messages. I sigh but keep that smile plastered on my face. A girl. A new friend? We talk. She’s nice. I feel the candle start to melt, oh no. There it goes wax over wax until it’s all spilt and a new cast is formed. The girl’s face twists and contorts to reveal an empty reflection. Her face opens up and she spreads her lies and more people shift away from me. I want to shout but my tongue has sealed in my mouth. Why can’t I be loved? She spits her venom and leaves me all alone. Everyday repeats the same. She spits more words and the makeup gets thicker, clothes get baggier and hair gets shorter. I can feel the fuse about to snap so I drown it in lighter fluid. I cry and beg till I am shifted to a new school. A new reality.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-tact-white-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-tact-white-background-color has-background is-style-dots\"/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center has-large-font-size\">Chapter 2</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-tact-white-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-tact-white-background-color has-background is-style-dots\"/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">I am liked. I sit at tables full of people but the hollow feeling remains. The poison of my mother’s voice creates a wave of anger and resentment radiates off my bones. People talk to me but don’t want to know me. The fuse is short and constantly drowned but the mind never shuts down. The constant flow of toxicity and despair suffocates you from the inside.

But they didn’t just use their own money to buy Utd, they borrowed most of the money and then, once they had purchased the club, they transferred their debt to the club. Since 2005 the club has paid out £815m in debt interest repayments &amp; £197m in external net debt repayments. Just for good measure, the club has paid out £10m in management and administration fees to Glazer family companies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What has this got to do with children’s social care?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, these are precisely the financial arrangements that private capital use to buy chains of residential children’s homes and fostering agencies. They borrow the money to buy them and then load the debt onto the children’s home company or fostering agency they have just bought.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-tact-brand-light-pink-background-color has-background is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-8cf370e7 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-vertical is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-8cf370e7 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta \">\n\t<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta__inner\">\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta__left\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta__image\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"image-bubble\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2024/06/andy-elvin5329-343x343-1.jpg\" alt=\"Andy Elvin TACT CEO\" title=\"Andy Elvin TACT CEO\" srcset=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2024/06/andy-elvin5329-343x343-1.jpg 343w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2024/06/andy-elvin5329-343x343-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://tactfostering.org.uk/content/uploads/2024/06/andy-elvin5329-343x343-1-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 343px) 100vw, 343px\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"quote-bubble\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<svg width=\"164\" height=\"144\" viewBox=\"0 0 164 144\" fill=\"none\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<path d=\"M33.4844 9.58621C61.8844 -8.81379 93.5 3.92638 109.484 9.58621C184.5 38.9263 175.484 121.086 118.984 138.586C62.4844 156.086 26.9844 122.086 9.48441 88.0863C-8.01559 54.0863 -2.01559 32.5862 33.4844 9.58621Z\" fill=\"white\"/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<path d=\"M90.7797 94.5568C80.2697 82.8104 87.4825 62.2025 96.3438 54.3716C103.763 47.571 116.127 42.0069 117.364 44.0677C119.218 47.1588 112.006 49.2196 106.442 54.1655C99.6411 61.5843 97.3742 64.8816 106.854 69.0031C116.952 73.5369 117.158 78.0706 117.57 83.8408C118.188 98.0602 101.084 104.655 90.7797 94.5568Z\" fill=\"#E11F8F\"/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<path d=\"M51.2119 94.3504C40.7019 82.604 47.9146 61.9961 56.776 54.1652C64.1948 47.3646 76.5595 41.8005 77.796 43.8613C79.6507 46.9524 72.438 49.0133 66.8738 53.9592C60.0733 61.378 57.8064 64.6752 67.286 68.7967C77.3838 73.3305 77.5899 77.8642 78.0021 83.6344C78.6203 97.8538 61.5158 104.448 51.2119 94.3504Z\" fill=\"#E11F8F\"/>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</svg>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t<div class=\"wp-block--quote-cta__right\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"acf-innerblocks-container\">\n\n<p style=\"font-size:24px\">&#8220;This is money intended to pay for the care of some of the UK’s most vulnerable children.

The issue is that the debt must be serviced, and interest payments covered. So, who’s paying off the interest on all this leveraged debt? Well, you and I are: the debt interest is part of the fees these firms are charging Local Authorities to look after children in residential or foster care. This is money intended to pay for the care of some of the UK’s most vulnerable children. Instead, it is paying interest (at rates way above the Bank of England base rate) on debt that has been artificially inserted into the children’s social care market. The lenders tend to be Hedge Funds controlled by multi-millionaires; they are adding to their fortunes by collecting interest from money that was intended to transform the lives of children in care.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Has this approach improved the quality and location of homes for children? Well in 2024 in St Helens, one of the smaller Local Authorities in England, there were 37 children&#8217;s homes, with 34 run by private providers. Millionaire owners who borrow their money from fellow millionaires don’t want to invest in homes near where children come from when they know full well that Local Authorities will have no choice but to send children hundreds of miles away to children’s homes in St. Helens, Blackpool and other areas where large property is more affordable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Government could act to end this practice. The previous Government rejected amendments 145 – 147 to the <strong><a href=\"http://(1)\thttps://hansard.parliament.uk/lords/2022-03-07/debates/94E636CE-A4D1-4380-940F-277A62CCB199/HealthAndCareBill#:~:text=Volume%20819:%20debated%20on%20Monday%207%20March%202022&amp;text=This%20amendment%20ensures%20that%20financial,%E2%80%9Cfinancial%20engineering%E2%80%9D%20or%20leveraging\">2022 Health &amp; Care Bill</a></strong> which would have addressed this issue effectively in adult social care and could have been extended to children’s social care.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is an opportunity for the government to introduce the rejected amendments, as amendments to the Children’s Wellbeing and School&#8217;s Bill currently passing through parliament. The ironically opaque practices of the Glazers allow the wider public to understand how inappropriate it is that these financial tools are allowed in the children’s social care sector. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s time for transparency in children’s social care.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Andy Elvin, TACT CEO</strong></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk/leveraged-debt-in-care-system/\">How Debt is Sucking Resources Out of the Care System</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://tactfostering.org.uk\">TACT</a>.</p>",
