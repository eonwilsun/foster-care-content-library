It is a clear indication that children and young people experience the highest quality care and support possible, enabling them to achieve their goals and ambitions that they may not have been able to. It reflects consistently excellent practice, robust safeguarding, and exceptional leadership across every part of our agency.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">For the Children and Young People in Our Care</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For children, this means they feel safe, valued, and genuinely heard by our foster carers and staff. They are supported to grow in confidence, achieve their goals, and experience the stability and encouragement they need to thrive. It shows that their voices matter and that their wellbeing is at the heart of everything we do.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">For Our Foster Carers</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For foster carers, this recognition reflects the high-quality training, guidance and round-the-clock support they receive, as well as the positive, lasting difference they make to the lives of the children in their care. Swiis foster carers are among the best in the sector, consistently providing nurturing, stable homes where children and young people feel safe, valued and able to thrive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Swiis foster carers know they are never alone. They are part of a supportive community, backed by a dedicated team who are always there, listening, guiding and standing alongside them, fully committed to their success and to the wellbeing and future of every child and young person in their care.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">As a Fostering Agency</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Ofsted only awards ‘Outstanding’ when a fostering agency consistently goes above and beyond for their foster carers and the children within their care. Having consistently ‘Outstanding’ ratings in all areas across our Midlands and South, North East, Yorkshire and North West offices is an exceptionally proud achievement for all Swiis staff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This accomplishment reflects the dedication, compassion and professionalism of every member of the Swiis team. It is a testament to the hard work our staff put in every day and to our unwavering commitment to achieving the best possible outcomes for children and young people.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Highlights From Our Ofsted Reports</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Across the Midlands and South, North East, Yorkshire and North West, children receive nurturing, individualised care that helps them make exceptional progress.

Swiis places strong emphasis on children’s engagement with education, ensuring their commitment and participation are actively supported. Every achievement, big or small, is recognised and celebrated by our teams, helping children build confidence and feel empowered to aspire to and reach their goals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“Specialist and bespoke support is provided by a dedicated team that works alongside children to break down any barriers to their learning.”</em> &#8211; Midlands and South Ofsted Report</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“Children’s education and learning progress are at the forefront of the agency’s practice.”</em> &#8211; North East Ofsted Report</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Swiis <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/fostering/support/\">Education Advisors</a> work closely with children and foster carers to understand each child’s unique learning needs and provide tailored guidance to overcome challenges. By prioritising education, Swiis ensures that every child and young person has the best possible opportunity to succeed, develop confidence, and achieve their full potential, while foster carers feel fully supported in helping children reach their goals.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Our Dedicated Stability and Support Team</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Swiis’s Stability &amp; Support Team provides foster carers with an additional layer of personalised guidance and one-to-one support, helping them respond confidently to any concerns or behaviours a child or young person may present. From the very beginning of their fostering journey, carers can access practical advice and proven strategies to support them through any challenging moments.&nbsp; The Stability and Support Team can be accessed directly by the foster carer if preferred and is in addition to the exceptional daily support of the social work teams.&nbsp; This wrap around support ensures foster carers are well equipped to create safe, nurturing environments where children can thrive, grow and overcome barriers they may face.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“Foster carers feel exceptionally well supported and valued by agency staff, which impacts positively on the outcomes of children who are thriving in their foster families.”</em> &#8211; North West Ofsted Report</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Exceptional Safeguarding</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Safeguarding is at the heart of everything we do at Swiis. Children and young people feel safe, supported and valued in our foster homes, cared for by experienced foster carers and supported by highly skilled and committed social work teams. We operate robust and comprehensive safeguarding processes to ensure the highest standards of safety and wellbeing for every child in our care.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Safeguarding is also central to our recruitment, assessment and approval processes. All foster carers and Swiis staff go through rigorous checks and preparation, ensuring they are well trained, confident and fully supported in their role. This strong safeguarding framework promotes stability and enables foster carers to provide safe, nurturing homes where children can thrive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“Safeguarding children is at the centre of the agency.”</em> &#8211; Midlands and South Ofsted Report</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Swiis, every decision and action prioritises the safety and well-being of children. This gives foster carers confidence that they are fully supported when protecting children, knowing they are not alone in ensuring the highest standards of care. Children, in turn, feel secure, protected, and able to build trust with the foster carers caring for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Comprehensive and Relevant Training</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Swiis provides foster carers with comprehensive and practical <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/fostering/training/\">training</a>, giving them the knowledge and confidence they need to meet children’s diverse needs. Well-trained foster carers can respond effectively to both every day and complex situations, helping children feel secure, supported, and understood at all times.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“Highly effective post-approval training ensures that foster carers have the relevant skills and knowledge to undertake the fostering role.”</em> &#8211; North West Ofsted Report</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Child-Focused Leadership and Staff</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Swiis is led by experienced leaders who provide strong oversight and inspire continuous improvement. Staff morale is high, workloads are manageable, and teams work closely together to deliver consistent, high-quality care. All regions have strong partnerships with other professionals to ensure children remain at the centre of all practice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“Foster carers have provided overwhelmingly positive feedback about the support they receive from the agency.”</em> &#8211; Midlands and South Ofsted Report</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Foster carers consistently report feeling valued, supported, and heard. This strengthens fostering home-finding arrangements, enabling children to thrive in stable, nurturing homes where their emotional and developmental needs are met.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“Staff morale is high, and staff say that they love their job.”</em> &#8211; North East Ofsted Report</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Motivated and passionate staff ensure children receive consistent, high-quality care. When staff feel proud and inspired by their work, it directly benefits foster carers and children, creating a supportive environment where everyone can flourish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“Social workers have manageable caseloads and are in weekly contact with their foster carers.”</em> &#8211; North West Ofsted Report</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regular, meaningful contact allows social workers to provide timely guidance, reassurance, and practical support.

Their role is to work directly with foster carers, offering tailored advice, practical strategies, and specialist guidance around behaviours and complex needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2025, this team had its busiest year yet. Demand grew as carers increasingly accessed this invaluable support, a clear testament to how impactful and trusted the service has become. In response, we expanded the team to ensure every foster carer receives timely, expert help when they need it most.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team also introduced specialist forum groups and topical webinar training, with subjects chosen by our foster carers themselves. This collaborative approach has empowered carers, strengthened peer connections, and further enhanced the quality of care provided to children.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-kadence-advancedbtn kb-buttons-wrap kb-btns27522_43a9fb-e5\"><a class=\"kb-button kt-button button kb-btn27522_dcaf50-18 kt-btn-size-standard kt-btn-width-type-auto kb-btn-global-fill  kt-btn-has-text-true kt-btn-has-svg-false  wp-block-kadence-singlebtn\" href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/fostering/support/stability-and-support-team/\"><span class=\"kt-btn-inner-text\">View The Stability &amp; Support Team</span></a></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Looking Ahead to 2026</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As we reflect on 2025, we do so with immense pride. This was a year of outstanding achievement, heartfelt dedication, and genuine transformation for children, foster carers, and staff alike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Together, we have shown what is possible when care, expertise, and passion come together. And as we look to the future, one thing remains certain: Swiis Foster Care will continue to go above and beyond, because every child deserves nothing less.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we move into 2026, our commitment remains unwavering. At Swiis Foster Care, we will continue to evolve and strengthen the support we provide to both our foster carers and the children and young people in their care. Everything we do is guided by one clear purpose: ensuring that every child can feel safe, nurtured, and supported to achieve their full potential.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those choosing to begin their fostering journey with Swiis, we are committed to making that experience as supportive, flexible, and stress-free as possible. From the very first conversation, through assessment, approval, and beyond, our focus is on supporting our carers every step of the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the next few months, we will be sharing more about the wonderful achievements of our children, celebrating their progress, resilience, and successes. We will also be highlighting the vital role of our social work teams and our foster carers, alongside the specialist provision offered by our Stability and Support Team, giving greater insight into how this enhanced support continues to make a meaningful difference for carers and children alike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, we will be sharing more details about the feedback from our Ofsted Outstanding inspection outcomes, helping to demonstrate what outstanding practice looks like and how it directly benefits the children we support.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/swiis-foster-care-highlights-of-an-extraordinary-2025/\">Swiis Foster Care: Highlights of an Extraordinary 2025</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com\">Swiis Foster Care</a>.</p>",

She liked the idea of helping children who needed a safe, stable home but she just wasn’t sure when the right moment would be.</p>\n<p>“I’d always thought about fostering and thought it would be a nice thing to do,” she says. “A friend of mine started fostering and said, ‘Would you like me to give you my social worker’s number?’ And it all started from there.”</p>\n                            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"content-block-block_1635c5a6c49a12f2fa426fcf05c7e1a0\" class=\"custom-block content-block alignfull has-none-background-color theme-none spacing-top-half spacing-bottom-half width-full\" data-columns=\"1\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n\n                    <div class=\"content\">\n                <p><span class=\"text-medium\" style=\"color: #e5007e;\"><strong>Moments that make it all worthwhile</strong></span></p>\n<p>Over the years, Debbie has welcomed many children with different backgrounds and needs. One young person stands out.</p>\n<p>“We had a child come to live with us who was quite challenging at the time,” she explains. “He was from another country, and his culture was very different to ours. It was challenging for him and for us.”</p>\n<p>Debbie never expected him to stay in touch — but he did.</p>\n<p>“When he left, I didn’t think he would keep in touch, but he did and he still does to this day. Any problems he has, or difficulties, or even achievements, he’ll always come back and tell us, which is lovely.”</p>\n<p>Another moment that means a lot to Debbie involves a young person she cares for now.</p>\n<p>“When she came to live with us, she found it quite difficult — especially around men, including my husband,” Debbie says. “As time went on, she got more relaxed. The moment she just went up and gave him a hug… that was really, really nice. That was one of my favourite moments.”</p>\n<p><span class=\"text-medium\" style=\"color: #e5007e;\"><strong>The qualities that matter</strong></span></p>\n<p>Debbie believes empathy is the most important part of fostering.</p>\n<p>“You need to have that empathy for children because they come from all different backgrounds,” she says. “For somebody to just turn up at your home and have to live with another family &#8211; it’s really, really hard. I’d find it difficult, let alone a little child.”</p>\n            </div>\n        \n        \n            </div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div id=\"image-text-block_cdc824443fe16ef527f9d99c228e6e7b\" class=\"custom-block image-text-block alignfull image-right has-none-background-color theme-none spacing-top-none spacing-bottom-full width-full\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"content\">\n            <p><span class=\"text-medium\" style=\"color: #e5007e;\"><strong>Support that’s always there</strong></span></p>\n<p>For Debbie, FCA’s support has made a big difference to her fostering journey.</p>\n<p>“We receive lots of support from FCA, and it can be in different ways,” she explains. “If there’s something we’re finding difficult or challenging, we can always go and ask. If there’s something we’re not sure of, there&#8217;s always somebody on the end of the phone. Even if our social worker’s off, there’s always someone we can contact.”</p>\n<p><span class=\"text-medium\" style=\"color: #e5007e;\"><strong>Her advice?</strong></span></p>\n<p>After 15 years, Debbie still loves fostering &#8211; and she encourages others to explore it too.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“If you’re thinking about fostering, it’s worth finding out more. You don’t have to know everything, you just need to care. The rest comes with support.”</p></blockquote>\n                    </div>\n\n                    <div class=\"media\">\n                <img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"625\"

Hosted by Faye, the podcast brings together real voices from across the <a href=\"https://www.polariscommunity.co.uk/\">Polaris Community</a>, including care-experienced people, foster parents, those who grew up in fostering households, and fostering professionals. Together, they talk openly and honestly about what fostering is really like – the ups, the challenges, and everything in between.</p>\n<p>In the first three episodes, you’ll hear from Jo August, our CEO, who grew up in a fostering family and brings over 35 years’ experience in the sector; Alison and Theresa, foster parents, sharing their personal journeys; and Jim McGarrigle, Responsible Individual across a number of our fostering services.</p>\n<p>All offering insight from years of professional experience. Together, they explore fostering from every angle, grounded in real life, not theory.</p>\n<p>The podcast is full of honest stories from foster parents, myth-busting conversations about fostering, practical tips, and insights from the journey. You’ll also hear from care-experienced staff, people who grew up in fostering, and long-time foster carers. It’s perfect for anyone who is curious about fostering, unsure if it’s right for them, or looking for reassurance from people who’ve been there.</p>\n<p>It’s a space to listen, learn, and reflect, hearing real experiences that can help you decide what fostering might look like for you.</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"emoji\" role=\"img\" draggable=\"false\"

So, I looked into fostering, got some information, found out about it… had lots of appointments, found out loads of details, and then decided to give it a go.”</p>\n                            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"content-block-block_495f5d7b0336fa434f1f5b1595062a73\" class=\"custom-block content-block alignfull has-none-background-color theme-none spacing-top-half spacing-bottom-none width-full\" data-columns=\"1\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n\n                    <div class=\"content\">\n                <p><span class=\"text-medium text-small-medium\" style=\"color: #1d57a5;\"><strong>Tracy’s introduction to fostering </strong></span></p>\n<p>Tracy’s first three years as a foster parent were with her local authority in Shropshire. But after relocating to the North West, she felt ready for a fresh start.</p>\n<p>“On our relocation, I got in touch with a foster carer who recommended FCA,” she explains. “So I got in touch with the agency. Somebody came round, we had a chat, and we went through the process again and joined <a href=\"https://www.thefca.co.uk/regions/north-west/\">FCA North West</a>.”</p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"text-medium text-small-medium\" style=\"color: #1d57a5;\">Keeping siblings together</span></strong></p>\n<p>Their first foster child was part of a sibling group, but only one child could be placed with them at the time. It made a lasting impact.</p>\n<p>“We saw the grief of a child who’d been separated from her siblings,” Tracy says. “So when she left our care, we decided we wanted a bigger family home so we could <a href=\"https://www.thefca.co.uk/about-fostering/types-of-fostering/fostering-siblings/\">foster sibling groups</a>. We wanted to keep them together.”</p>\n<p>That decision shaped everything that came next. Now Tracy and her husband care for three sisters, aged seven, eight and nine. “I’ve had them for the last three years,” she says proudly. “They’re long-term matched with me.”</p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"text-medium text-small-medium\" style=\"color: #1d57a5;\">Watching children thrive</span></strong></p>\n<p>For Tracy, the real highlights of fostering are the moments of growth.</p>\n<p>“The highlights of fostering, I’d say, are seeing the child thrive, grow and smile in your care,” she says. “To know that they can be happy and get on with their lives and still have contact with their birth family.”</p>\n<p>One teenager stands out in her mind.</p>\n<p>“She came into care having lots of difficulties at school. Through care, nurture and help, we got her back into a mainstream school. We got her the help she needed — the diagnoses she needed. She was actually dyslexic, but she’d been classed as a naughty child, a distracted child. With support, she sat her exams. That was a massive change.”</p>\n            </div>\n        \n        \n            </div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div id=\"image-text-block_cd3b6a5d4cfd61c6e5ee8d814052f518\" class=\"custom-block image-text-block alignfull image-right has-none-background-color theme-none spacing-top-half spacing-bottom-full width-full\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"content\">\n            <p><span class=\"text-medium text-small-medium\" style=\"color: #1d57a5;\"><strong>“The support with FCA is absolutely amazing.”</strong></span></p>\n<p>When Tracy talks about FCA, she doesn’t hesitate. “The support with FCA is absolutely amazing — one of the main reasons we made the decision to go with this agency,” she says.</p>\n<p>And the support comes in all shapes and sizes.</p>\n<p>“It’s foster carer get-togethers, activities they put on for the children — including birth families. We have monthly support groups in the North West. We meet at the Chorley office. There’s always something going on.”</p>\n<p><span class=\"text-medium text-small-medium\" style=\"color: #1d57a5;\"><strong>Her advice to others?</strong></span></p>\n<p>“If you’re thinking about fostering, I’d say give FCA a call.

Every year, around 36,000 children come into care; however, there are not enough foster parents available to care for them. This means vulnerable children are more likely to be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Separated from their siblings.</li>\n<li>Experience frequent moves.</li>\n<li>Live in residential care.</li>\n<li>Have their education disrupted.</li>\n<li>Live far away from the communities they&#8217;re familiar with.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Growing up without the stability of a safe and loving home can affect every aspect of a child&#8217;s development, from their ability to form relationships to the way they process and regulate emotions.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s why foster care is one of the most rewarding careers you can choose. Whether you provide a child with a safe home for a few nights or support them through school and prepare them for independent living, the work you&#8217;ll do as a foster parent can make all the difference to their life-long outcomes.</p>\n<p>Here are six more reasons why you should consider a foster care career in 2026.</p>\n                            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"content-block-block_32f3d291a34276433c5a62d0821047f3\" class=\"custom-block content-block alignfull has-dark-teal-background-color has-dark-background theme-none spacing-top-full spacing-bottom-full width-full\" data-columns=\"2\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n\n                    <div class=\"content\">\n                <h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">6 reasons to start fostering in 2026</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n            </div>\n        \n                    <div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n                                    <div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n                        <h3><span class=\"text-small-medium\">It’s a career that truly makes a difference</span></h3>\n<p>Unlike many desk jobs, fostering actively makes a world of difference. It’s crucial in helping to ensure the next generation of children grow up in healthy, secure environments with the chance to reach their full potential.</p>\n<p>Foster carers don’t just provide a safe place for children to live – they are role models, teachers and parents all rolled into one. With the help of foster families, foster children can learn to overcome trust issues, build confidence and grow into successful young adults with promising careers of their own. Many even go on to have careers in the foster care system themselves, creating a positive cycle of change.</p>\n<p>It’s not only life-changing for the foster children, but it’s also a rich, rewarding experience for you and your family. Fostering can open your eyes to new cultures, teach you things about yourself you never knew and give you a deeper purpose in life.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"text-small-medium\">You’ll leave a legacy that matters</span></h3>\n<p>Fostering is a career that enables you to leave a legacy that matters. Whether you offer long-term or <a href=\"https://www.thefca.co.uk/about-fostering/types-of-fostering/short-term-fostering/\">short-term fostering</a>, you&#8217;ll help children by passing on wisdom, supporting them through life&#8217;s ups and downs, and creating family traditions.</p>\n<p>It can be little things, like teaching a child how to brush their teeth, to bigger things like helping a teenager get back onto a positive path. Everything you do as a foster parent goes towards helping children develop independence and become the best versions of themselves. Now that’s something to be proud of.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"text-small-medium\">Thousands of children need a home</span></h3>\n<p>When a child enters the care system, they are scared and confused. Being separated from their birth family, even those who have been abusive or neglectful, can cause a child significant stress.</p>\n<p>In England, there are over 80 thousand children considered looked after, and they need loving, supportive foster parents who can provide them with the stability they need to thrive.</p>\n<p>When you decide to embark upon a foster care career, you’re not just choosing a job to pay the bills. It’s a commitment to giving every child the opportunity to live a happy, healthy life.</p>\n                    </div>\n                                    <div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n                        <h3><span class=\"text-small-medium\">You don’t need any experience</span></h3>\n<p>You don’t need to have superpowers to be a brilliant foster parent. Skills you’ve learned in previous jobs, through having your own children or nuggets of wisdom you’ve picked up in life, can play a big part in your role as a foster carer.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thefca.co.uk/resources/blogs/latest-blogs/care-workers-make-great-foster-carers/\">Transferable skills</a> like empathy, being a good listener, compassion, resilience, an open mind and having a bucket-load of patience are all traits we look for in future foster parents.</p>\n<p>You don’t even need previous experience in caring for a child. Of course, this is an added bonus if you have, but it’s the personal qualities that stand out to us. As long as you’re determined to make a difference, we can help you become a great foster parent.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"text-small-medium\">Professional development and 24/7 support</span></h3>\n<p>With many careers, it’s easy to hit a ceiling; however, being a foster parent means you’re always learning something new. At FCA, we understand that fostering is a career, which is why we actively encourage your professional development.</p>\n<p>When you join us, you&#8217;ll have access to our <a href=\"https://www.thefca.co.uk/about-us/training/\">high-quality training courses</a> where you can enhance your existing skills or specialise in specific areas, such as fostering children with trauma, disabilities, or autism. Our ongoing approach to training will equip you with the knowledge and skills needed to care for children with varying needs.</p>\n<p>Fostering with FCA is also like joining a big family. You’ll have a network of professionals at your fingertips, as well as a community of other like-minded foster parents to share experiences with. From dedicated social work <a href=\"https://www.thefca.co.uk/about-us/support/\">support and therapy services</a> to peer support groups and regular fun events in the community, you’ll realise that when you foster a child with FCA, you’re never alone on your fostering journey.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"text-small-medium\">You’ll receive a generous fostering allowance</span></h3>\n<p>Fostering a child has its challenges, so it’s only right that we reward you for your hard work and dedication.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thefca.co.uk/about-fostering/fostering-agencies-vs-local-authorities/\">Independent fostering agencies</a> (IFAs) pay more than local authorities, but the exact amount you get depends on where you live and the child you’re fostering.</p>\n<p>The allowances cover all the costs of caring for a child, including meals, clothes, bills and presents. You also get a minimum of 14 nights paid respite, which is where the child in your care lives with another foster family while you have a well-earned break.</p>\n<p>There are also additional bonuses for the length of service and hitting fostering milestones. The <a href=\"https://www.thefca.co.uk/allowances/\">fostering allowance</a> also gives you a number of tax exemptions and won’t affect any of your existing benefits.</p>\n                    </div>\n                            </div>\n        \n            </div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div id=\"image-text-block_0aa6c6e70e30e01a658f1bbfe8b55590\" class=\"custom-block image-text-block alignfull image-left has-none-background-color theme-none spacing-top-full spacing-bottom-full width-full\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n        <div class=\"content\">\n            <h2>Start your fostering career today</h2>\n<p>We could give you 101 reasons why you should consider a career in foster care and why it is so important, but the main one will always be the fact that you get the chance to transform a child&#8217;s life.</p>\n<p>If you want more information about fostering, download our <a href=\"https://www.thefca.co.uk/guides/fostering-beginners-guide/\">Beginner’s Guide to Fostering a Child handbook</a>.

Together, they have three children of their own two daughters and a son and our proud grandparents to four grandsons.  Before becoming a foster parent, Annette spent 16 years working in a residential home supporting adults with learning disabilities, where she was a deputy manager. Today, her life centres around caring for her foster children and her grandchildren which she finds incredibly rewarding.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"text-small-medium\"><strong><span style=\"color: #e5007e;\">Why foster?</span></strong></span></h3>\n<p>Annette tells us what made her consider fostering “I think I always wanted to be a mum. I come from a big family of ten children, and I’m the fourth eldest, so having a busy household felt natural to me. After having my own children, I still found myself talking about fostering. I always thought that if I had the space and a spare bedroom, I’d love to do it. I admired people who fostered, I just thought it was brilliant.”</p>\n<p>“I never had the fear of ‘how would I give them back?’ If you do a good job, you know that’s part of the role, and you’ve helped a child. When our eldest eventually moved out, we had a spare room. One evening, while my youngest daughter and I were having dinner, she said, <em>“Mammy, all my life I’ve heard you and Daddy talk about fostering. Now we’ve got a spare room what’s stopping you?”</em></p>\n<p>That very night whilst scrolling through Facebook we saw an advert for FCA and clicked on it, that’s how it all started.”</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n                    </div>\n\n                    <div class=\"media\">\n                <img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"625\" height=\"622\" src=\"https://www.thefca.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Annette-Harkin-625x622.jpg\" class=\"attachment-half-width-desktop size-half-width-desktop\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://www.thefca.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Annette-Harkin-625x622.jpg 625w, https://www.thefca.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Annette-Harkin-365x363.jpg 365w, https://www.thefca.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Annette-Harkin-176x175.jpg 176w, https://www.thefca.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Annette-Harkin-299x298.jpg 299w, https://www.thefca.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Annette-Harkin.jpg 720w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px\" />            </div>\n            </div>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"content-block-block_05381d895d5e2cce135db5370404b2da\" class=\"custom-block content-block alignfull has-none-background-color theme-none spacing-top-none spacing-bottom-half width-full\" data-columns=\"1\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n\n                    <div class=\"content\">\n                <p>For their family, fostering wasn’t a huge shock. “I was a bit nervous at the start, because you never know what challenges you’re going to face,” Annette explains. But their children and wider family were supportive. In fact, fostering runs in the family as Gerry’s brother and his wife are also foster parents, so it wasn’t a big surprise that Annette and Gerry were taking the step themselves.</p>\n<p>One particularly heart-warming story involves a pair of twin boys. FCA called to match one of the twins with Annette and Gerry, while the other had already been matched with Annette’s cousin, who also fosters with FCA. At the time, Annette didn’t realise it was her cousin, though she recognised the family name. Although the cousins had never met and didn’t know they were both fostering with FCA, everything became clear once the connection was made. The boys were then able to meet regularly and form a strong bond. “It’s really brilliant,” Annette says. “My cousin is like a sister now.”</p>\n<h3><span class=\"text-small-medium\" style=\"color: #e5007e;\"><strong>Best fostering moments</strong></span></h3>\n<p>“When I think about some of my best fostering moments, our first foster child will always have a special place in my heart. Being our first, he made a huge impression on us.”  Annette explains.</p>\n<p>“It’s the same with our little girl we have living with us now, watching her grow in confidence, seeing her feel safe enough to be herself, is incredible and that makes everything worthwhile.”</p>\n<blockquote><p>For me, the best moments are seeing the children blossom, seeing their confidence grow, and knowing they feel safe enough to just be themselves. When a child can truly be themselves, without having to put on a front, you know they’re content and happy. That’s what fostering is all about.</p></blockquote>\n<h3><span class=\"text-small-medium\" style=\"color: #e5007e;\"><strong>Support from FCA </strong></span></h3>\n<p>Annette describes the <a href=\"https://www.thefca.co.uk/about-us/support/\">support</a> she has received from FCA as “amazing and outstanding.” She speaks very highly of her supervising social worker, who she feels she can confide in without judgment, gives her the space to express her feelings openly and she is always available if needed.</p>\n<p>“She’s one of the best <a href=\"https://www.thefca.co.uk/about-us/support/social-work-support/\">social workers</a>, she should be cloned,” Annette says.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"text-small-medium\" style=\"color: #e5007e;\"><strong>Suming up her fostering experience </strong></span></h3>\n<p>When Annette reflects on her fostering journey, she describes it as interesting and challenging but above all, it’s the best thing she has ever done.</p>\n<p>“I would have loved to do it years ago,” she says, “but at the time we just didn’t have the space. We didn’t have a spare bedroom.” Even so, she has no doubts that fostering came into her life at exactly the right moment.</p>\n<p>For Annette, fostering has been incredibly rewarding, she has formed strong friendships and become part of a close-knit community of fellow foster parents. One of her favourite parts of fostering is the monthly support group, which she looks forward. She values the opportunity to share experiences, learn from others, and gain fresh perspectives. Hearing how other foster parents approach similar challenges has helped her think differently and broaden her understanding. “It really opens your mind,” she explains.  Ultimately, while the impact on the children is what matters most, Annette says the friendships, family connects and support she’s found through fostering and through FCA have been truly amazing.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"text-small-medium\" style=\"color: #e5007e;\"><strong>What would your advice be to new foster parents?</strong></span></h3>\n<p>“One of the biggest lessons I’ve learned from fostering is not to take things personally. Children who come into your home might say some of the worst things imaginable. Often, they simply don’t know how to express how they’re feeling. It’s important to separate yourself from it, even though it can feel very personal in the moment.  I genuinely enjoy fostering. One thing I’d say to anyone considering it is: absolutely go to the support groups. Honestly, it makes everything so much easier. You learn so much and knowing you’re not alone makes a huge difference.”</p>\n<h3><span class=\"text-small-medium\" style=\"color: #1d57a5;\"><strong>Get in touch today</strong></span></h3>\n<p><a

Here is her story</p>\n<p>After 37 years in the classroom, I was always determined that I would retire as close to my 60<sup>th</sup> birthday as possible.  I wanted to spend my retirement finding out more about life and enjoying new experiences, be it volunteering, learning new skills or travelling.</p>\n<p>I was aware that I would miss the company of young people and the joy of being with them as they grew and discovered the world around them.  I felt I still had skills to offer.  An invitation from the FCA fostering agency to attend an introductory meeting to looked interesting and a warm welcome from the social worker encouraged me to go further.</p>\n                    </div>\n\n                    <div class=\"media\">\n                <img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"625\" height=\"469\" src=\"https://www.thefca.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Alison-Baker-625x469.jpg\" class=\"attachment-half-width-desktop size-half-width-desktop\" alt=\"Alison foster parent FCA South East\" srcset=\"https://www.thefca.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Alison-Baker-625x469.jpg 625w, https://www.thefca.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Alison-Baker-365x274.jpg 365w, https://www.thefca.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Alison-Baker-875x656.jpg 875w, https://www.thefca.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Alison-Baker-176x132.jpg 176w, https://www.thefca.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Alison-Baker-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.thefca.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Alison-Baker-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://www.thefca.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Alison-Baker-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https://www.thefca.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Alison-Baker-397x298.jpg 397w, https://www.thefca.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Alison-Baker-952x714.jpg 952w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px\" />            </div>\n            </div>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"content-block-block_6733c1c7327e7f3590fd5d08cda881c8\" class=\"custom-block content-block alignfull has-none-background-color theme-none spacing-top-none spacing-bottom-half width-full\" data-columns=\"1\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n\n                    <div class=\"content\">\n                <p>I opted for <a href=\"https://www.thefca.co.uk/about-fostering/types-of-fostering/short-term-fostering/\">short term fostering</a>; I welcome children and young people for just a few days or weeks.  In some cases it may only be for 24 hours: I currently welcome a young person every month for an overnight stay.  The reasons why the young people need to come to me vary: it may be because their full-time foster parent is ill, or there is family illness, a bereavement or a holiday was booked before the child came to live with them.</p>\n<p>Since retiring eight years ago I have welcomed around 20 young people aged between 5 and 17.  and have greatly enjoyed being with the children who have stayed with me.  One young man came to me every summer for two weeks from age 11 to 17.  He first appeared as a very shy, nervous boy but grew into a confident adult who was ready to take on the world.  The longest period that a young person stayed with me was an asylum seeker who was with me for 11 months.  I’m an approved parent and child carer and have welcomed two new mothers with their babies for short breaks. There have naturally been one or two challenges, I have learnt how to manage type 1 diabetes and epilepsy, but our training gives us a good basis and the social work team is very supportive.  There are regular support meetings for foster parents and it is always a pleasure to get together.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.thefca.co.uk/about-fostering/how-to-become-a-foster-parent/fostering-panel/\">approval process</a> begins with a short introductory course which is designed to give the prospective foster parent an understanding of what is involved followed by training with and assessment by a social worker.  I found the training to be thorough; it often covered aspects of child development that I wished I had known more about during my career in education.</p>\n<p>I have appreciated the flexibility of being able to say when I could welcome a child and when it was not possible.  This has entirely fit in with my retirement plans and so doesn’t interfere with being able to accept opportunities to enjoy the theatre and cultural life and to take trips abroad.  Information about a child is usually provided in advance and I only agree to welcome children if I am confident that I can offer them a good experience; as it’s just me at home that can be very important.  In addition, the fostering allowance has provided a very welcome top up to my pension.  As a Waspi woman this has been particularly beneficial.</p>\n<p>Becoming a foster parent has been one of the best decisions I have ever made and I can wholeheartedly recommend it.  Spending time with some wonderful young people, having fun with them, listening to them, cooking and gardening with them and laughing with them has helped to make my retirement truly special.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"text-small-medium\"><strong>Get in touch today</strong></span></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thefca.co.uk/enquiry/\">Call our

      "content": "<p>As parents, we endeavour to raise children who are healthy, happy, and ready to take on the world. Watching them grow into confident young adults and eventually leave the family home is such a natural part of life, but when that day comes, it can stir up a whirlwind of emotions. After years of sharing laughter, teaching life skills, and helping them believe in themselves, the house suddenly feels a little quieter. It is a big change, and adjusting to this new chapter takes time.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Is an Empty Nester?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>An empty nester is a parent whose children have moved out of the family home. Young adults leave for many reasons, such as attending university, starting a career, moving in with a partner, or simply beginning a new chapter in their lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This transition brings a new lease of life for some parents, offering the freedom to try new things and explore new hobbies with their newly found time. However, for others, the change can be emotionally challenging.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Challenges Do Empty Nesters Face?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It is natural for empty nesters to experience feelings of loneliness or uncertainty as the house becomes quieter. The familiar routines that once shaped the day, washing uniforms, cooking meals, supervising homework, being a taxi driver or simply knowing that a child was home safe, are no longer there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many parents find this shift surprisingly emotional. Often called ‘empty nester syndrome’, it can bring sadness, loneliness, and even a sense of grief. Missing the structure, the laughter, and the sense of purpose that once filled the day is common, and adjusting to a quieter home takes time.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Can Fostering Support Empty Nesters?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Even when children grow up and move out, the instinct to support, care for, and guide others often remains strong. Fostering offers a meaningful way to open both your heart and your home to a child or young person who needs stability, understanding and encouragement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fostering is not about replacing grown children. Instead, it brings new purpose and an opportunity to make a meaningful difference in a young life. It allows parents to continue offering warmth, reassurance, and a sense of belonging to children and young people who need it most.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Empty Nesters Make Great Foster Carers</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Empty nesters often make excellent foster carers for many reasons. Years of raising children provide valuable experience in navigating the challenges and milestones of childhood and adolescence. While having children is not a requirement for becoming a foster carer, this experience provides skills that are highly beneficial in caring for a young person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Empty nesters understand the daily responsibilities of parenting and preparing a child for independence in a safe and caring environment, which is the overall goal of fostering. Over the years, they also develop patience, effective communication, problem-solving skills, and emotional understanding, all of which are essential qualities for successful foster carers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Thinking About Becoming a Foster Carer?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The home may feel quieter now, but this next chapter can be filled with connection, purpose, and the joy of making a lasting difference in a child or young person’s life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are thinking about becoming a foster carer or have any questions about how fostering can help fill your empty nest, <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/contact/\">contact our recruitment team</a>, who can answer any questions you have and provide you with information on the excellent <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/fostering/support/\">support</a>, <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/fostering/training/\">training</a> and <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/fostering/fostering-allowance-pay/\">allowance</a> Swiis offers.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/what-are-empty-nesters-and-why-they-make-great-foster-carers/\">What Are Empty Nesters and Why They Make Great Foster Carers</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com\">Swiis Foster Care</a>.</p>",

Gareth has worked for Swiis for 8 years and loves working with the children in foster care who need educational support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In his free time, Gareth loves travelling and embarking on long treks, which not only clears his mind but also allows him to discover new places and meet interesting people. He has a passion for cooking, rugby, exercise, and DIY projects &#8211; he even recently converted an old van into a campervan! A fun fact about Gareth is that he once taught young people how to drive on a race track at Castle Combe. His dream destinations are Vietnam and Thailand, where he looks forward to immersing himself in the vibrant culture and cuisine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let us explore Gareth’s role as an Education Advisor, where he shares his insights on guiding foster children to unlock their full potential.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Your Role at Swiis Foster Care</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What is your job title, and how long have you worked for Swiis?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“I am the Education Advisor for Midlands and South, and I have been employed with Swiis for nearly 8 years.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“My role also allows me to support our placement support team in organising participation events and attending foster carer support groups to advise on how young people can be supported in their education.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What motivated you to work in foster care?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“I wanted to learn how to support children and young people outside of their school environment, support foster families and help improve their lives inside and outside of school.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What does your role as an Education Advisor entail?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“It is always evolving, however, my main responsibilities are to empower foster carers to support children’s education and outcomes and to ensure all children looked after within our care have the best opportunities to enable them to achieve good outcomes in their education, health and well-being.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What does a day in your role look like?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“A normal day would include discussing issues and concerns that have been raised with other professionals in a multi-agency context, ensuring information to support young people is shared, and to monitor, record and update young people’s progress and to attend education meetings. I am also involved in the participation of events and activities throughout the year.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Where does your department fit in the fostering process?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“Once foster carers are approved, I contact them and offer advice and guidance on how children and young people can be supported in their education. This would include offering guidance concerning policy, children’s rights, school transitions and those young people transitioning to independence, such as university, work and other apprenticeships. Throughout the time the children are with our foster carers, I support and advocate for the children and foster carers.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Fostering Insights</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How do you help provide foster carers with the correct educational support at home?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“Every child has a right to education, but some children who experience care, struggle in education for many reasons, including having to move to new areas on multiple occasions. This often means having to spend the first few days or weeks in the new foster home without education. My role would be to provide the foster carer with the appropriate resources to support the children’s learning, depending on their needs and abilities. Secondary to this, I would work with other agencies and schools to ensure that the most suitable school provision can be sourced, and the young person is given the opportunity to attend school at the earliest opportunity. As well as this being vital for their learning, it is also important for them to make friendships with their peers, appropriate adult relationships with adults and to give them social opportunities within their local community.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How does your role help to support the child in care and their foster carer?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“I would normally introduce myself and explain my role to new foster carers so they are aware of how they can be supported with any educational issues or concerns. Types of support include training in how to advocate for their young people during PEP (Personal Education Plan) and EHCp (Education, Health Care Plan) meetings, advising of their rights and responsibilities, advising foster carers and young people in how to use and access resources that will enhance and support their learning.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What are some of the most memorable achievements you have seen from a child or young person?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“Hearing the feedback from a young unaccompanied person who attended a university experience visit with the Swiis Midlands and South team. They informed me that the day would ‘stay with them forever’ and that it had inspired them to do well in their studies and attend a university in the future. The young person in question has since moved on to further education and is doing very well in his studies.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“Another memorable experience was being with a group of foster children on a day visit to the Donkey Sanctuary and seeing them all play, laugh and eat ice cream together. They loved the day out. This type of event offers children the chance to interact with peers and adults in healthy, supportive environments, helping them learn social and life skills necessary for future independence.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“Also, producing a Podcast with a young person who shared their thoughts and feelings on meaningful topics that affected their lives, such as bullying and identity. The young person felt extremely proud and hoped that it would help other young people. It is essential to provide foster children with a voice for their well-being and development, enabling them to express their emotions and thoughts. It also helps to shape decisions that impact their lives.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What do you think are the best qualities a foster carer should have?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“The best qualities I think a foster carer should have in supporting young people are to show they are interested and invested in helping them with their well-being and safety by listening to them, showing them warmth, being inclusive of their needs and including them as part of the family. By appropriately advocating for their needs when communicating with health, education and social services will also show the young person they are being supported and listened to. The best qualities foster carers can possess are a combination of emotional, practical, and interpersonal abilities.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gareth’s perspective on the educational <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/fostering/support/\">support</a> offered by Swiis highlights our commitment to empowering foster children and young people to achieve academic success.

Here are some other benefits of keeping a keen eye on your finances:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Prevents overspending and credit card debt.</li>\n<li>Allows you to put money aside for emergencies.</li>\n<li>Gives you scope to save for long-term goals, such as home improvements or that once-in-a-lifetime holiday.</li>\n<li>Helps you save for fun activities, special occasions, and weekends away.</li>\n<li>Keeps you in control and fully aware of your financial situation, which can reduce stress and anxiety.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Helps you provide a stable home for children in your care where all their needs are met and they have opportunities to explore their interests.</p>\n<p>Regardless of which <a href=\"https://www.thefca.co.uk/about-fostering/types-of-fostering/\">type of fostering</a> you choose, during your assessment, we’ll take a look at your financial situation to make sure you don’t have any financial obligations that could make it difficult for you to meet the needs of the children you foster. We also do this to ensure that if you experience a gap between caring for children, it won’t put you in a tricky position.</p>\n<p>This means it&#8217;s a good idea to get on top of your finances before applying to avoid delays during the assessment process. Below are our tips to help you get started.</p>\n            </div>\n        \n        \n            </div>\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"content-block-block_a3d0b6cae6eca17530e43f3402d4a6ba\" class=\"custom-block content-block alignfull has-none-background-color theme-question-mark spacing-top-half spacing-bottom-none width-narrow\" data-columns=\"1\">\n    <div class=\"container\">\n\n                    <div class=\"content\">\n                <h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Tips for managing your money as a foster parent</h2>\n<h3><span class=\"text-small-medium\">Create a realistic budget </span></h3>\n<p>The key to creating a budget that you’ll stick to is making it realistic. If your budget is overly strict, the chances are you’ll find it difficult to maintain, so be honest with yourself when you start the process.</p>\n<p>Obviously, your budget will include money you receive from your fostering allowance, benefits and job (if you <a class=\"Hyperlink SCXW28635768 BCX0\" href=\"https://www.thefca.co.uk/fostering-allowances/can-i-work-foster/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><span class=\"TextRun Underlined SCXW28635768 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-GB\" xml:lang=\"EN-GB\" data-contrast=\"none\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW28635768 BCX0\" data-ccp-charstyle=\"Hyperlink\">work while fostering</span></span></a><span class=\"TextRun SCXW28635768 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-GB\" xml:lang=\"EN-GB\" data-contrast=\"auto\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW28635768 BCX0\">)</span></span>, as well as non-negotiable bills that you pay every month, such as gas and electric, water, mortgage or rent, and insurance.</p>\n<p>However, to create a realistic budget that helps you stay conscious of where your money is going, you need to review your past and present expenditures. So download your bank statements and work out how much you currently spend on groceries, subscriptions, hobbies, and treats and add these to your budget. This way, you&#8217;ll see how much you have left over for savings or something you really want to buy.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"text-small-medium\">Set yourself achievable targets </span></h3>\n<p>If you want to reduce spending or save for something special, instead of eliminating everything that brings you joy from your budget, set yourself some realistic targets that you can actually achieve.</p>\n<p>For example, if your grocery bill has gotten a bit out of hand and you find yourself throwing food away, you could aim to cut it by £20 or £30. If you realise you have multiple streaming subscriptions but only really use one, you could cancel the others.</p>\n<p>These little tweaks to your spending will add up over time, helping you reach saving goals faster while still being able to spend money on the things you enjoy.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"text-small-medium\">Use a budgeting tool that works for you </span></h3>\n<p>Throughout the year unexpected expenses are more than likely to occur, so there’s no point creating a budget and never looking at it again.</p>\n<p>Find a budgeting tool that doesn’t feel like a chore to use so you’ll engage with it regularly. Here are some examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Planners:</strong> If you prefer to put pen to paper, a <a class=\"Hyperlink SCXW182759446 BCX0\" href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Budget-Planner-Organizer-Notebook-Effectively/dp/B08P48Z5VZ/ref=asc_df_B08P48Z5VZ?mcid=7df042aee03a3ba8837da9faadb63c2e&amp;tag=googshopuk-21&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=697341551435&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=17858278061153985505&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=1006656&amp;hvtargid=pla-1188691317800&amp;psc=1&amp;hvocijid=17858278061153985505-B08P48Z5VZ-&amp;hvexpln=0&amp;gad_source=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><span class=\"TextRun Underlined SCXW182759446 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-GB\" xml:lang=\"EN-GB\" data-contrast=\"none\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW182759446 BCX0\" data-ccp-charstyle=\"Hyperlink\">budgeting planner</span></span></a> could work for you.</li>\n<li><strong>Spreadsheets</strong>: If you are a dab hand at Excel, why not create a spreadsheet?

Before you know it, budgeting will become a breeze.</p>\n<h3><span class=\"text-small-medium\">Focus on your own financial goals </span></h3>\n<p>In this day and age, we’re bombarded with advertisements from retailers, travel agents and influencers persuading us to part with our money for a product, experience, or service.</p>\n<p>Couple this with our social media feeds being flooded with photos of piles of Christmas presents, new cars, and holidays, and it can be easy to get sucked into buying something you don’t need or can’t really afford to ‘keep up’ with friends and family.</p>\n<p>In reality, everyone&#8217;s financial situation is different, and you never truly know how other families fund their lifestyles or if their finances are in good health. Take buying a new car, for example, <a class=\"Hyperlink SCXW127962600 BCX0\" href=\"https://www.firstresponsefinance.co.uk/insights-and-tips/industry-news/uk-car-finance-index-2025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><span class=\"TextRun Underlined SCXW127962600 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-GB\" xml:lang=\"EN-GB\" data-contrast=\"none\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW127962600 BCX0\" data-ccp-charstyle=\"Hyperlink\">over 80%</span></span></a> are purchased using finance.

But you can still save money by being a savvy shopper.</p>\n<p>When you foster with FCA, as part of our support for foster parents, you receive access to The Exchange, our exclusive foster parent rewards platform. All you have to do is log in, and you’ll find discount codes, instant vouchers, and reloadable cards that help you save money on everything from daily essentials to holidays, days out, and more.</p>\n<p>It even includes a handy calculator to help you work out how much you could save, along with a SmartSpending app that gives you access to discounts and deals on the go.</p>\n<p><strong>Here are a few more easy ways to save money when you shop: </strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use loyalty cards: From free drinks and exclusive discounts to vouchers for days out, holidays and more, loyalty cards are a really simple way to save cash.</li>\n<li>Buy pre-loved items: Whether you need a lawn mower, a bicycle for your foster child, or something else, Vinted, eBay, and Facebook Marketplace are your friends for saving money, with many items sold &#8216;like new&#8217;.</li>\n<li>Meal plan: Save money and prevent waste by only buying the food you need for your weekly mean plan.</li>\n<li>Have groceries delivered: When groceries are delivered, not only does it save time, but it also prevents you from adding things you don&#8217;t really need to your trolley, and you can see the running total while you shop.</li>\n<li>Buy discounted food through apps: At the end of each day, shops, restaurants, and cafes often have food that they won&#8217;t be able to sell the next day, but is too good to be thrown away. These businesses use apps like <a class=\"Hyperlink SCXW211092472 BCX0\" href=\"https://www.toogoodtogo.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><span class=\"TextRun Underlined SCXW211092472 BCX0\" lang=\"EN-GB\" xml:lang=\"EN-GB\" data-contrast=\"none\"><span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW211092472 BCX0\" data-ccp-charstyle=\"Hyperlink\">Too Good to Go</span></span></a> to sell mystery bags of food and drink at a fraction of the original price.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Managing your money may sound like a bit of a slog, but over time, it&#8217;ll become second nature and you&#8217;ll feel better knowing that you have your finances under control. It&#8217;ll also free up your mind to concentrate on helping children and young people heal from their past, create new positive memories, and work towards a brighter future.</p>\n            </div>\n

In our <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/locations/yorkshire/\">Yorkshire</a> region, a group of musically talented individuals known as the Swiis Superstars have come together to create their very first original music track called ‘Our Moments’!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the lead-up to their production day, the young people dedicated time to planning, collaborating, and bringing their ideas to life. The group decided that their song would focus on growing up in foster care, and each young person played an important part in the creative process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One young person, J, a talented lyricist and rapper, wrote the lyrics by drawing inspiration from his own experience in foster care. Alison, a Swiis Senior Placement Support Worker, said, <em>“The speed at which J was able to put the words together was incredible!”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the lyrics were complete, R began experimenting with different sounds on a guitar to complement J’s words. After the group agreed on the perfect sound, E added in additional guitar tones, while P and S helped to create the beats, and PB added rhythm through their impressive beatboxing skills.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the Swiis young people, G, also played a big part in creating the song and was eager to use their talent on the vocals. Unfortunately, they were not able to attend on production day, but we are really looking forward to hearing their musical talent in the future!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When production day arrived, the Swiis local office was transformed into a lively recording studio, giving everyone the perfect space to come together and create their brand-new track.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the song was complete, the group also wanted to create a cover for their track. They chose a dragon to symbolise courage, and one of our talented young people brought that vision to life by mocking up a design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are incredibly proud of the Swiis Superstars for their teamwork and creativity throughout this project. They have such great passion and talent for music and have created a track to be proud of, and we are thrilled to share it with you!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Our Moment - Swiis Superstars\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Sx6aT5bKIOk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/swiis-superstars-release-their-first-music-track/\">Swiis Superstars Release Their First Music Track</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com\">Swiis Foster Care</a>.</p>",

      "content": "<p>Children of foster carers play an essential role in the fostering household, and they contribute so much to the lives of the foster children and young people placed in their home. The patience, understanding and support that children of foster carers give to foster children and young people does not go unnoticed, and we are thankful for their dedication to helping transform the lives of others less fortunate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We had the opportunity to speak with Holly about her experience, who, along with&nbsp;her older brother, grew up as a child of foster carers. Holly’s parents began fostering with Swiis in 2010, and shortly after their approval, they welcomed a foster sibling group of two females and two males into their home. With the foster children ranging in age from infancy to six years old, Holly, who was just nine at the time, quickly went from being the youngest in her family to having four younger foster children in the home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She recalls her dad introduced the idea of becoming a foster carer, and because her grandmother had been fostering for years, Holly already understood what it meant to welcome children in need into her home.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>“I remember being really excited about it and excited for my dad’s new career path.”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Holly shared with us some of her favourite earliest memories with the foster children.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em> “The female foster children and I all used to love it when I would do their makeup and paint their nails when we were younger. I take pride in knowing that they have always looked up to me and I’ve loved watching them grow up into beautiful, strong, and kind young women.”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the years, Holly has been amazed at&nbsp;watching each of the foster children in the home grow and thrive. She has seen the youngest foster boys adapt to the challenges of high school and overcome any social difficulties.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>“I’ve loved seeing the youngest boys grow up and mature, and love that the youngest often wants to spend time with me just to chat about his day and ask me about my life. The two female foster children are at that age now where we can talk like friends as well as sisters, and I love being able to talk and gossip about girl stuff and have fun with them outside of ‘older sibling duties’!”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>As Holly became no longer the youngest in her family, it meant that there was a shift in the role she played in the household, she stepped up, taking on more responsibilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>“I feel like I took on a lot of responsibilities from a younger age as I felt a bond early on and wanted to help care for them the best I could. The last few years I’ve occasionally helped my parents with babysitting when they want to go out for dinner or enjoy a holiday away, or even small moments when they want to go out for a walk.

The week was created to recognise and celebrate the incredible role that the children of foster carers play within a fostering household.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether a foster carer’s child is young, a teenager, or has grown up and moved out of the family home, the children of foster carers often provide support to both their parents and the foster child or young person. Some responsibilities they have can include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Being a positive role model for the child or young person</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Supporting with everyday tasks, such as school pick-ups or cooking</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sharing personal things like toys, books, or games</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Helping them learn about responsibilities within the home</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Offering a listening ear and someone they can talk to</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout the week, we will be sharing case studies from children of foster carers to highlight their experiences and the vital role they play in the fostering household. These stories highlight how fostering has impacted their life and the amazing memories they have had watching foster children and young people develop over their time together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To kick start Children of Foster Carers week, we spoke to Lockie and Pippa, who shared what their favourite memory with a foster child or young person has been so far, what they enjoy most about being part of a fostering household, how their responsibilities may have changed over time, and any additional thoughts they wanted to share.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Lockie – Aged 9</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What has been your most memorable or special experience with a foster child?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“When we all went to Disneyland at Christmas. It was good having L to go on all the rides with, especially the bigger ones, because my sisters don’t like them. We like the Spider-Man ride the most, shooting webs with our hands and wearing the 3D glasses.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What do you enjoy most about having a foster child in your home?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“L plays football with me in the garden and plays Roblox with me on the Xbox.

If so, how?</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“They have stayed the same even though things have changed. I enjoy playing with toys and reading stories.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Is there anything else you would like to share about your experiences?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“I have found it to be really positive having my parents be able to foster, even though it does have its sad times, like when they move on to adoption.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>To view more case studies from Children of Foster Carers, take a look at our <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/info-hub/\">Info Hub</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Thinking about becoming a foster carer?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are interested in learning more about becoming a foster carer,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/contact/\">get in touch with our recruitment team,</a>&nbsp;who can answer any questions you have about fostering and provide you with information on the excellent&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/fostering/support/\">support</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/fostering/training/\">training</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/fostering/fostering-allowance-pay/\">allowance</a>&nbsp;Swiis offers.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/children-of-foster-carers-week/\">Children of Foster Carers’ Week</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com\">Swiis Foster Care</a>.</p>",

For some families, this means their child has spent most of their life as an only child, until the family decides to welcome foster children into their home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was the case for Summer, who grew up as an only child for 13 years before her parents began fostering two girls, aged 1 and 12 at the time. While the transition from being an only child to suddenly having other children in the household can be a big adjustment, Summer embraced the change and quickly thrived in her new role as the oldest child in the family.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like any change in routine, fostering comes with challenges that the whole family must navigate. But for Summer, the rewards far outweigh the difficulties.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>“I have a few things that I enjoy about us being a foster family. I love that there is always someone to spend time with and chat with. I also really like that when we became a foster family, Dad started spending more time at home because he left his old job, and now I get to see both Mum and Dad all the time, which is really nice.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“I like that we are a bigger family now. When our house and my Auntie’s house get together, there are over ten of us. We used to just be three, but now we are five, and I really like that.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“I also like that we all share things and help each other. For example, J played with my rabbit, Princess, last week, and while she was with her, she cleaned her out, which I was really happy about because that’s usually my job. In return, I helped J organise her wardrobe. We just do everything together.”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the past couple of years, Summer’s relationship with the foster children has blossomed, and together they have already created so many memorable experiences.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>“My favourite thing we have experienced together is our holiday. We have had so many amazing times, but without a doubt, going to the Caribbean as a family was my favourite. The things I took for granted on holiday, they were just so excited about, and I really enjoyed sharing those moments with them. Plus, every time we wanted to play in the pool, there was always someone to play with.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“Things like the plane ride stood out to me. I moaned about being on the plane for 9 hours, but they were so excited and grateful for just getting the opportunity to go on the plane.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“We also went zip-lining through the Caribbean Lake Park, which was really special. That is one of my favourite memories ever.”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>As Summer’s relationships with the children have grown, her role within the household has changed, and she has taken on more responsibilities as the oldest child.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>“It’s great how my responsibilities have changed! I used to have the jobs of dishwasher and recycling, but now J does the dishwasher, and I do the recycling, so we have split the jobs, which is good because I didn’t like the dishwasher, but J doesn’t mind it.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“I am the oldest now, so I do older sister stuff, like reminding P to put her coat on and trying to teach her how to fasten her shoelaces. I also taught J how to straighten and curl her hair.”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>As Summer has taken on new responsibilities at home, she has also had time to reflect on how fostering has shaped her life and how it might influence her future. When asked if there was anything else she would like to share about her experiences, Summer said:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>“Fostering has been in my life since I was really young. I was 6 or 7 when Auntie started, and then 12 when Mum and Dad started, so I am pretty used to the fostering world now. Since we started fostering, we have had really good days, but also some really difficult days. Everyone tells us ‘It’s a journey’, but that’s because it actually is.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“I’m really happy with where we are now though, life’s normal for us. I feel really proud that we foster, and I have even started thinking about becoming a foster carer myself when I’m older. I’m going to finish Uni and get my degree, but I really do think I will take a similar path and foster. I want to foster teens. Seeing how J opened up to me when we chatted, I think I’d be good with teens.”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Summer’s inspiring story of growing up as the child of foster carers highlights the incredible experiences and memories that fostering has given her, as well as how it has influenced her future. Fostering can be a life-changing experience for everyone involved, not just the children and young people in care, but for the entire family.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Thinking about becoming a foster carer?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are interested in learning more about becoming a foster carer,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/contact/\">get in touch with our recruitment team,</a>&nbsp;who can answer any questions you have about fostering and provide you with information on the excellent&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/fostering/support/\">support</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/fostering/training/\">training</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/fostering/fostering-allowance-pay/\">allowance</a>&nbsp;Swiis offers.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/children-of-foster-carers-summers-story/\">Children of Foster Carers &#8211; Summer’s Story </a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com\">Swiis Foster Care</a>.</p>",

For many children of foster carers, it means learning to share their home, toys and even their parents&#8217; time, but for those older children who are now adults no longer living at home, fostering impacts them differently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This has been the case for Harmeet, as when her parents decided to foster, she was no longer living in the family household, but she still experienced the rewards of fostering and found ways to support her parents and the children in their care.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>“Seeing a foster child feeling safe and happy at home is rewarding because we are able to work together and provide a stable and caring environment. Even though I don’t live at home, I support my parents by helping care for the children when they are away for the day. It’s meaningful to be part of that support system and contribute in any way I can.”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Fostering brings many new responsibilities, and it is not only the foster carers themselves who have a change in responsibility, but also everyone close to them who plays a part in supporting the journey. For Harmeet, she has played a massive part in supporting her parents with the children and young people they foster, and it has taught her valuable emotional and interpersonal skills.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>“My responsibilities have changed since my parents began fostering. Even though I no longer live at home, I now help more with caring for the foster children when I visit or when my parents are out for the day.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“I might play with them, help with meals, or just keep them company so they feel safe and supported. It has taught me the importance of consistency and patience, and I feel proud to be part of something that really makes a difference.”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the years that Harmeet’s parents have fostered, she has built many wonderful memories with the children and young people who have joined their family. Each new arrival has brought new experiences, and Harmeet continues to form special bonds with all the children her parents look after, making a lasting impact on her.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>“One of the most memorable experiences I had was with a foster child who came into our home at the age of 3. From the beginning, we built a strong and positive bond. I enjoyed getting her small toys and gifts, which always brought her joy. Although I no longer see her in person as often, we stay connected through regular video calls. She lights up with excitement every time we talk, and seeing that joy reminds me how meaningful even the smallest connections can be in a child’s life.”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Harmeet’s story highlights that even when a child of foster carers is an adult and no longer living in the family home, they can still be deeply impacted by the rewarding experiences that fostering brings. It has given Harmeet a new perspective on responsibility and shown her just how meaningful fostering can be in a child or young person’s life.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Thinking about becoming a foster carer?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are interested in learning more about becoming a foster carer,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/contact/\">get in touch with our recruitment team,</a>&nbsp;who can answer any questions you have about fostering and provide you with information on the excellent&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/fostering/support/\">support</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/fostering/training/\">training</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/fostering/fostering-allowance-pay/\">allowance</a>&nbsp;Swiis offers.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/children-of-foster-carers-harmeets-story/\">Children of Foster Carers &#8211; Harmeet&#8217;s Story</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com\">Swiis Foster Care</a>.</p>",

For her, the addition of foster children and young people felt natural, and a lot of her daily life remained the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>“Having foster children was great, it was like inviting our ‘bonus family’ into our home. We extended our family to those who need it most and seeing them grow and progress into young adults is one of the most rewarding things I have experienced.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“I also don’t feel anything changed when we gained our bonus family. We made sure they felt safe and secure, but we lived our lives as normal with our new additions.”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>During the years of being a child of a foster carer, Rachel was part of countless special memories that ranged from small, everyday moments to life-changing events. From playful afternoons in the garden to the celebrations of important milestones, these experiences left a lasting impression on her.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>“Over the time that my mother was a foster carer, we had many memorable experiences, so it&#8217;s hard to choose one! I remember setting up a water slide in our garden on a summer&#8217;s day, which ended up in a big water fight with lots of laughs! We have shared memories on holidays, life celebrations, and milestones. One of the biggest highlights was when we had the honour of reuniting a child with her mother after around 10 years of separation. It brought tears to everyone’s eyes. What an amazing moment to be a part of!”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The impact of fostering as a child of a foster carer stayed with Rachel, and today she has followed in her mother’s footsteps, becoming a foster carer herself, which Rachel would encourage all to try if they can.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><em>“I would like to add that if anyone is considering fostering but unsure due to their birth children, in my experience, it added a level of gratitude, empathy, and love that I wouldn’t have experienced if my mother didn’t foster. Seeing those children grow to the amazing individuals they are today encouraged me to become a foster carer myself. I have now been doing this for almost three years, and I’ve enjoyed it from day one.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“Give it a go and change some lives!”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>To read more about Rachel and her mother, Vicky’s fostering journey, you can read their story <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/story/vicky-and-rachels-fostering-story/\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Thinking about becoming a foster carer?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are interested in learning more about becoming a foster carer,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/contact/\">get in touch with our recruitment team,</a>&nbsp;who can answer any questions you have about fostering and provide you with information on the excellent&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/fostering/support/\">support</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/fostering/training/\">training</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/fostering/fostering-allowance-pay/\">allowance</a>&nbsp;Swiis offers.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/children-of-foster-carers-rachels-story/\">Children of Foster Carers – Rachel’s Story</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com\">Swiis Foster Care</a>.</p>",

They are social and I wasn’t, they liked going out to places, and I preferred staying at home. And I guess I wasn’t really used to the environment of a nice home and family dinners and showers/baths every night.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My first night, I cried loads. I missed my bed, and I felt like I made a very awful decision. But they made me feel so welcome. The first day, I had a nice relaxing bath, they gave me my space and let us get what we wanted for tea. And honestly, nothing has really changed since that day other than that we are more comfortable around each other, and I am so much happier now that I got the chance to be with such lovely people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ever since the first day, they have always been there for me, no matter what. They are always so caring and helpful. They are so supportive of everything I do. Every time I am upset, they always notice, and they are right on track to figure out what is wrong and try their best to help with the situation. And of course, if I want or need any space, they will respectfully give me some.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not just them, the whole family are the most welcoming, caring and loving people anyone could ever ask for, and I feel like I warmed up to everyone quite fast. Living with them all has made me a better person.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My mental health overall has been so much better than it was while I was with my mam. I have a healthier diet. Sarah and David make sure we are getting proper, nutritious food, instead of fries and chicken nuggets all the time. They also make sure everyone is okay with having that food for tea, and if someone isn’t, then normally small adjustments will be made. For example, when they make Curry, we aren’t that big on spice, so they make us a non-spicy “curry”. (By “we”, I am referring to me and my brothers).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They always buy us things that we need, even if we don’t ask them to. Like one day it can just be brought up in a conversation, then a few days later it arrives. Obviously, they are responsible and try to teach us the value of money, so they don’t just buy us anything we want. If we want something that’s quite pricey or just a silly little thing, then we save up for it. If it is school related, or something crafty, just anything that would get us away from devices, or if its hygiene related, then they will buy it for us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They are quite chill and relaxed and don’t let things people say bother them. They are constantly reminding me that people will just say things out of jealousy or boredom and that I should just ignore what people think or say about me. If they want to do that, then they can go ahead and do it. Why should it be my issue, I know I&#8217;m a good person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whenever I am stressed, they always try their best to help me out as much as they possibly can. There was a moment when I was constantly stressed in school, and it would cause me to scratch my skin. Sarah wasted no time getting me a fidget ring and bracelet to distract me, and she would give me some cream for my wounds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Honestly, I have been such a better, happier and healthier person since living with them, and they have impacted my life in an amazing way. Even people at school have been saying that I look so much better than I used to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also have become a slightly more sociable, confident and productive person and I feel like I get more things done now. And I socialise with people a bit more since we are always going out. I have become more confident with myself, I used to be so insecure and now I don’t let that bother me as much. I’ve even been doing more and better at subjects in school because I don’t have as much stress as I used to when living with my mam. I have been able to hand in my homework on time, get a lot of work done in lessons, and revise properly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They are the reason I am the person I am today.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel like they would have an amazing impact on my future. I will actually have people to talk to about things like what to do when leaving school, how to find a job, how to deal with all sorts of payments, getting a house, college, and university. Just overall, how to be a good person.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel like I will actually have someone to help me through any hard times I have, someone I can actually talk to about things. I am no longer afraid of growing up, because I know that I am surrounded by amazing people who will support me and be there for me through thick and thin.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I lived with my mam, I was constantly afraid of growing up. I wanted to be dead by the age of 16 just so that I didn’t need to live a life like my mams.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sarah and David have given me and my brothers such a safe environment to be in. They have given us the opportunities to experience different things and to explore more things, to figure out what we enjoy doing and what we don’t enjoy doing. They don’t let us give up, but they don’t force us either. They just give us a slight nudge to get us started, then let us continue the rest.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They have made my life so much better in such a small amount of time, and I will forever be grateful to them and their whole family. I will always be grateful for everything they have done for us.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you so much for taking the time out of your day to read my letter. I really appreciate the chance to share a part of my story with you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have an amazing day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sincerely – N”</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Has this letter inspired you to become a foster carer?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>N has beautifully shown within this letter how much of an impact becoming a foster carer can have on a child or young person&#8217;s life.

      "content": "<p>&#8216;Children in care&#8217; over the age of 3 years old must have their own room. It may be possible for siblings to share a room if they are of the same gender, of an appropriate age, and it has been decided by the local authority responsible for children that this is agreeable. The Local Authority will assess each situation to determine if sharing a room is in the child’s best interest.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Would Foster Siblings Not Share a Bedroom?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While some <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/fostering/types-of-fostering/sibling-fostering/\">foster siblings</a> may have a close relationship, sharing a bedroom is not always the best option due to the complex emotions children often experience. Many children in foster care have undergone trauma, whether from experiences with their birth parents or the stress of being separated from them. In some cases, these past experiences can strain sibling relationships, even leading to conflict or bullying. In some situations, sharing a room can provide comfort and security, while in others, it may harm the child&#8217;s well-being. Therefore, the decision for siblings to share a room should be made on a case-by-case basis to ensure the arrangement benefits each of the foster children.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Does a Foster Child Need Their Own Bedroom?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A foster child needs their own bedroom as it is considered a safe space for them. One of the main reasons children enter foster care is due to abuse and neglect from their birth parents. Having a space to call their own gives them the privacy and sense of security they need and deserve. It also allows them to have a quiet area where they can read, play or do their homework. This is especially important in a fostering household with more than one child in it, as it can often be overwhelming to some, so a peaceful place that they can call their own is essential.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Do You Have a Spare Bedroom and Want to Make a Difference in a Child’s Life?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are considering becoming a foster carer and meet the requirements, such as having a <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/do-i-need-a-spare-room-to-foster/\">spare bedroom</a>, being over 21 years old, holding British citizenship or indefinite leave to remain, and being medically fit to work, then contact our <a href=\"https://www.swiisfostercare.com/contact/\">recruitment team</a>.
